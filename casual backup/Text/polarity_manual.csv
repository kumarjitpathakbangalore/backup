"1","after attempting to fix my  months of broken push notifications with all suggestions i thought i try one more thing i havent tried  it worked   notifications problem gone    i recommend to try it  i just figured out when your all your notifications are switched on but your skype contact chat screen notification turned off your contacts will not get a notification from you at all  visa versa   after establishing all phone  in app in your skype profile are all switched on go to each of your skype contacts  within the chat screen go to the chat notifications  see if turned on  tap the three dots on the bottom right hand corner  chat menu comes up  tap notifications  turn it on   now contact each of your skype contacts  ask them to go into each of their contacts chat screen  switch notifications on   once i got each of my skype contacts to check their chat sessions  had them switch notifications on the problem went away     give it a try it it would be nice for feedback it worked    good luck  hope it works for everyone",0
"2","skype as long as its installed  logged on becomes a background service i do like the look of the current version but i do hate how it runs there was a problem regarding it running in background in the past where despite exiting the application through signing off with automatic signon enabled the app would reopen itself if someone called you let alone even sent you a file   now signing off literally logging off is the only way to stop the app the biggest downside is having to log in again if you swipe away the app from your recent apps display the sticky notification still remains you can turn it off but sometimes you dont want that option off when skype is actually running you cant win you just cant win   when the app is off the app should be off and shouldnt display calls of files when the app is swiped the app should also be off   there should also be an option to exit the app instead of signing off exiting the app and signing off of the app are two different things period",0
"3","good evening  in an automated updates deployment workstations that office  lync client installed actually installed updates that were intended for skype for business  client none of these workstations had had the kb update installed that actually updates   from lync client to sfb client and were all functioning as traditional lync clients    however they all installed update kb that is security update for the sfb client this resulted in some strange behaviour the lync icons changed to sfb icons lync within the startmenu changed to sfb yet the ui remained the same  the   lync client ui not sfb ive uninstalled the kb from the affected workstations and everything is now back to normal even stranger this didnt affect all of our workstations but only a small number  all utilising the same version of the lync client   the updates were deployed through an automated sccm update   does anyone have any idea what has occurred here im completely baffled im also concerned that this could reoccur in future the changes were only subtle and so we didnt notice them on our test deployment systems    thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this post     m tipler",0

"5","hi remus im not entirely clear on all your questions but   lync doesnt have any dependency on an existing voip solution its an enterprise grade unified communication product a suite of services and as part of that suite is capable of acting as a complete voip telephony solution in its own right providing   you deploy the required lync roles  servers and supporting components sbcs sip trunks etc then you can connect your lync environment to the pstn and use it as a complete replacement for any telephony system that said if you do have an existing pbx    telephony system that you would like to retain and have coexistence with then that possible as well regarding soft clients the lync desktop client is just one type of endpoint that a user can make and receive calls on they might also use desk phones   conferencing devices or qualified contact centre products to name a few   as mentioned above you cant use another vendors softphone with lync youd use the msft lync client software     lync works natively with microsoft exchange calendar integration conversation history etc all work out the box providing exchange is healthy and configured correctly if you were to use exchange  with lync as a telephony solution then it will   also handle your voicemail functionality  this requires the deployment and configuration of the unified messaging role on the exchange serverss   unfortunately im not over familiar with bcm and cant vouch for any enhancements or benefits that you might gain your call log history is saved directly in outlook via exchange but im not sure youll get any click to call functionality which is   what i think youre getting at there  kind regards  ben    note if you find a post informative please mark it so using the arrow to the left if it answers a question youve asked please mark the thread as answered to aid others when theyre looking for solutions to similar problems or queries",0

"26","good day  i have noticed that if i have started a lync conversation with someone during the entire day that it stores multiple copies of the conversation in my conversation history folder let me explain with an example  i talked with john doe from amam uninterrupted it will store that convo into the history folder with a size of kb  i come back to john around am and talked to him for another hour uninterrupted outlook will then combine the earlier conversation and append this convo to the bottom and save it in the history folder with a size of    kb however   if you look at the history folder it will still save the first conversation kb and have this new convo as well kb it does not cleanup the first conversation  the cycle continues throughout the day where i have multiple conversations with john and they get stored in multiple times without removing the old one end result we get a potentially large  of conversations stored chewing up a lot of space  i have been manually doing the cleanup of duplicate messages to free up space this leads me to the question on whether if there is a cleanup mechanism or setting i need to enable so that i can avoid this manual work  your responses are greatly appreciated  sunny",0
"27","hi    thanks for the response i have been trawling through technet for this issue but most of those responses quote a module that is failing    i have seen the ones mentioning updating drivers for cameras and graphics cards with varying degrees of success any newbuild machines with office  including lync work fine without needing driver updates it is only when adding lync  to   a pc that has lync  and a webcam that this issue comes up  the lync updates are deployed through sccm also but these are not resolving the issue    ive tried one driver update for the microsoft hd  webcam and that made no difference either updated drivers and patches still getting this error when opening lync    when removing lync  standalone and installing office  including lync there is no problem and there is a known issue with the oct in the lync  sp media meaning we had to deploy using a configxml  is this another known issue   that means this deployment media from microsoft cant be used to deploy lync   we are in the situation with several hundred users all with varying hardware now having lync  that crashes on startup we would like to resolve this without requiring reboots or hardware recalls if anyone can suggest any help it would be greatly appreciated   pushing out full office  is not an option unfortunately    thanks",0
"28","hi all  i am doing a research on seeing the feasibility of a voip solution for our company but as i came across ms lync it seems to have additional features like making phone calls through it instant messaging conferencing outlook integration  makingphone   calls by clicking the contacts number and all  now i see that after going through multiple documentations and wherever i could find more detailed information on lync and telephony i have the following questions   do we need a voip solution in place that will help us connect to any phone number from what it looks like we do from a desktop seems like it will link up with the voip soft client for the call   if we do need a voip solution in place will it work with any voip provider or do they have to have a specific voip customization with lync soft phone client integration any reference links if possible   outlook integration with lync i had a check on this reference it seems that it does a rpc call thus i take it we wont have to modify our exchange server  to allow integration with lync   business contact manager bcm  integration with lync  i searched as much as i could regarding this where phone call option is available in bcm but as i take it that it works for dialup modems only but with lync along with voip would   be able to initiate the call so that it could be tracked during the process as per log history    thanks in advance  thanks and regards  remus",1

"38","hi mark  question  basically if i go through all my users  at a time to make sure the third box is unchecked all my users will have the exact same setup on the other two boxes  is this correct  is there a work around so that i can make sure all users have the third checkbox unchecked while maintaining their other settings  i have done some tests for example there are five users  user a and b only check record and nonarchived user c and d only check allow and nonarchived user e only check nonarchived  when you choose these five users at one time you only uncheck nonarchived box and didn’t change anything about other two boxes record and allow after that the boxes of nonarchived are unchecked for all users and other settings record and allow keep the original settings  question  what happens if the recording feature is checked in the admin portal for an e licensed user  also does skype for business eliminate the difference between lync basic and lync full making the recording feature a nonissue  since e users use skype for business lync full version the recording feature is available for them normally e users use skype for business lync basic version and the recording feature is not available for the basic version if the recording feature is checked in the admin portal for an e licensed user nothing will happen due to the skype for business clients’ version  question  also does skype for business eliminate the difference between lync basic and lync full making the recording feature a nonissue  skype for business lync basic provides all the basic functionality of the full version of skype for business however if you want to use any of the following features you will need to upgrade to lync    advanced call features not available with all office  subscriptions advanced call features include team ring call forwarding simultaneous ring voice mail call park call delegation response groups and remote call control calendar delegation gallery video view onenote sharing recording skill search not available with office  virtual desktop infrastructure vdi not available with office   you can click the link below to know more information  what is lync basic  if anything is unclear please feel free to post back  best regardserick",0

"40","well this scam happened to me yesterday you would think people would learn ha ha i have seen posts on here date back to  regarding this if even  out of  people scammed paid the money i would imagine this number would be higher than just one though multiplyed but the amount of scams they can execute in  day over a  and a half year period these guys will be quite well offnbspanyway my story started on a dating website someone mailed me after liking my profile and what i was kind of taken back because she was very pretty obviously fake so after a little conversation she asked for my facebook acount which i stupidly gave her however the other stories i have read all say that they were added on facebook where as i was not anyway there was a video call made and it gotlets say fruity lol after around  mins or so the call was ended and a video of myselfbeing fruity was on screen andi glanced to see that it was getting sent over facebook i instantly pooped my pants and slammed the laptop closed contemplating my options i went to my mothers laptop and checked happy days nothing is there i return to my laptop to find they are still conversing with melike i said at the start we were never friends on facebook but this is exactly what was said to menbspi just sent your video has name removednbspbut it was my mothernbspand ill send it has all your other friends now i swear ill rot you life with this video and do not think that you got me your facebook personal you wrong you i have all your friends list and i am even friends with some of your contacts as i stay with my mother i then went back to the computer to check and there was nothing there obviously scare tactic and he probably didnt know we lived in the same house so this made me think how he actually got the contacts because my facebook is privatenbspanyway he demanded  euros so i asked him if he was daft that amount of money cant be raised in one day plus it is pm here everything is shut so he very kindy gave me till am this morning it is now  and i have heard nothing after watching a youtube video and reading on here i am going to do absolutle nothing about this as i said before i have read posts on this site dating back to  on this same scam if the video had been leaked there would be something about it in that period from then to nownbspi am also led to believe that if the video is released that is exactly how they would get traced and caught i really dont think they would ruin a very successful andnbsplucrative scam the number of people that will instantly pay this will massivly out weigh the people who wont paynbspwhat i have done is change every password i had reported the scammer to skype reported the video to youtube telling them i want it removed as it is being used against mein a blackmail scam and the video was labeld my name perverse masterbating infront of yo child i tols youtube that is this video surfaced it would undoubtably have severe concequences i refreshed the page and it was gone on facebook i have changed my actual name to something different changed alot of privicy settings to only me made my friends list available to only me the final thing i am doing right now is making a file of all the screen shots pictures and everything else and sending it to interpol i understand telling people to go to your local police station if they have any their powers to get anythingdone will be very low as this is an international crime it should be interpol that is notified documenting the information they gave you of where to send the moneynbspmy scammers name is  stephaniepleintnbspi hope that this post will put some peoples mind at rest a little i suppose its still early days yet but i am confident that nothing will come of it",0

"175","the skype program beyond version  has a ui that is utterly useless for my wife who has vision impairment prior to the forced update to version  my wife was able to use the software with large font read what was on the screen and was able to work with the software as it was now when she tries to use her large fonts because of the lay out with the new software and the video chat placement with the chat on the side she cant see any thing any more just lines of color but no text with the old way with the video at the top and the text on the bottom she could read at least one sentence at a time but now its uselessnbspthere has to be a way to fix this but at this time im getting the feeling that its been designed this way and our only recourse is to like it the way it is or find a competitors program that still offers customization of the lay out on the screen as it stands now if she wants to use the current version of skype her only recourse is to enable accessibility options and have her chat read to her as if she was totally blindnbspwile this is helpful for those people who need that kind of help my wife was able to use the program with out audio only a month ago and now it has been improved but the improvement has not been seen as such by my wife and i plus having your computer read things to you wile your in a video chat is not very helpfulnbspshe needs to be able to see links and other things that are being sent to her that she needs to be able to click on right now theyre hidden by the ui changes if something can actually be done to help in this matter that would be great but im worried this message may fall on deaf earsnbspthe message groups are full of people who are utterly furious about the ui changes but nothing substantial seams to happen the overall lay out and function of older versions compared to now is night and day references to giving your chat room to breath have been made seriouslynbspthese are all visual preferences that should be adjustable by the users people with vision impairments need the tools to be able to actually control lay out on their systemnbspare there any real plans to put in place some working visual tools to allow for classic view or giving the users control over layout of the skype ui because telling some one with visual impairments who was able to use a program just months before that its been upgraded and its new and improved and its the best skype has to offer and o buy the way you have no choice in the maternbspthis is all rather insulting to our intelligence nbspothers have been resorting to venting their rage and anger with language that has been edited by the forum moderators but nothing of substance appears to be happening in regards to the problems people have been complaining about nbspwhether they have been voicing those complaints polity or notnbspi dont know what else i can say at this point so ill add my bit of digital paper to the pile maybe some one will see this who can actually make a difference and maybe notnbspit was worth a trynbspvery frustrated long time skype user",0

"177","dear allnbspfrom reading this and similar threads it appears thatnbspthe issue has been around for quite a while several years i should say andthat there isnt a single solution that may satisfy allwith this in mind however i should like to share my own experience and the way by which  eventually  things seem to have fallen nicely in place hopefully some of you may be able to use the same steps i did to stop skype from autoreverting to online status when all you want is to remain invisible nbspsome of you mentioned that the issue seems to be somehow related to the mobile appnbspyou appear to be correct the trouble however is to discover all of the mobile apps you have installed and that are sharing the same skype namenbspin my case besides using skype on a couple of pcs as well as an android smartphone i overlooked the fact that i also had skype installed same skype name  on a pc on a dongle you know that little device that looks like a diskonkey and connects via hdmi to a regular tv set to practically turn it into an android pcthat dongle while not permanently on the tv display it was permanently turned on and  along with it  the skype app running in the background you get the picture nbspfrom the moment i turned this latter skype instance to invisible as well as the instance running on my android smartphone of course the pc instances stopped from autoreverting to online just in case anybody wonders how to manage this on an android device on the topright side of the screen is displayed the default avatar for your own persona click on it and from the resulting submenu select invisiblenbspa couple of lessons to be learned from the abovenbspregretfully it looks as if microsoft has not implemented on android the same policy it had for windows namely the one that forced all skype instances to accept the same status as the one most recently implemented on any of the running instances and to logon in a new instance while preserving the most recent running statusin view of the above if you dont want to be autoreverted to the online status just make sure that all mobile devices are set to invisible and do so within a short interval of time to prevent one device anihilating your steps from the previous one nbspof course point  is just a workaround the solution should come from skype  microsoft by implementing the old good policy from windows in the mobile devices toonbsphope this helpsnbspgood lucknbspericnbspps as an afterthought if anyone wishes to get a reply from skype support see lt  gt i believe they may be contacted directly and not only through the community forumnbspnbsp",0

"260","hii ran into the same problem as a lot of other people seem to have donenbspi am changing isp and because of that i have to change my mail address from my  year old email removed for privacy and security to something else this time i choose to use an outlookcom address in the hope that i will be able to keep that a bit longernbsplast week i realized that my skype account had my old expiring address as the primary mail and that the primary mail was the only mail that skype will use for communication with me  i already had  other mail addresses in my skype profile outlookcom and gmail the skype account was created last summer using my microsoft account and the microsoft account is the only means i have for accessing the skype account so i logged on and opended the profile page went on to edit the info and marked my outlook mail as the primary clicked save and got the password question i entered the password i use for logging on ie the microsoft account password but was told that the password was wrong i tried everything and some more things i spent  minutes on a text chat with skype support only to be told that it cant be done and that the skype account was hard tied to the mail address i had used when creating the account which i found very strange as i had used my microsoft account yes when i created the skype account the only mail i had connected to the microsoft account was my email removed for privacy and security mail but i have since then without any problems been able to create an outlookcom address and have that added added a gmail account set the outlookcom as the primary for the microsoft account and remove the email removed for privacy and security address from the microsoft account no problemthe problem is actually worse as the mail account will be free for use after april  which means that a person claiming that mail address will risk getting extremely confusing mails regarding a skype account they dont have they will have difficulties creating a skype account of their own and they can take over my skype account as they are the owners of the mail address and i wont be able to stop themnbsphow is that for security   nbspfortunately i spent  more hours and stumbled on the solution nbspthis is where a normal scam artist would ask you to click on a link to a web apge that would releive you of all your money but i wont do thatnbspso what is going on when you want to change the primary email why isnt your password acceptednbspit turns out that when you create a skype account using your microsoft account and i guessnbsp your facebook account skype will actually create a proper skype user account as well but they hide it from you andnbspyou wont get a password set for it it is the password for this hidden account you have to enter when you want to change the primary password  it turns out that i was also unable to connect my facebook account to my skype account for the very same reason but here it was more obvious as i had to enter my skype username and passwor when connecting the accounts and the microsoft account wasnt accepted there nbspso what do you need to do well  those of you who have a smart tv or some other device that cant log on to skype using a microsoft account have already done the work provided you use that tvdevice with skype you log on to skype andnbspopen the account settings page on the line below microsoft accountnbspnbsp yourmailaddressnbsp unlinknbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp change microsoft password youll see a line saying tv or device or something similar i have no idea what the english text is here you have a link you can click on where you will be prompted to enter the password for your liveusername account once you havenbsp done that you get instructions saying that for smart tvs etc you enter liveusername as the skye user and the newly created password as your passwordthe good news is that you now have  the identity of your skype user live and your name where the user name is the combined string liveusername which in my case was livemyname and  a password that is valid for your skype account whatnbspinbspdid nextnbspwas open up the profile page edit the profile mark the outlookcom mail address asthe primary click save and when prompted for the password i entered the password i set in the previous step and thats it i now had a new primary mail i got the confirmation mai sent to the new mail address right after i updated the info in skype i also successfully removed my soon defunct mail address from the mail address list in my skype account and i then connected my facebook account to my skype account using livemyname ase the username and my shiny new passwordnbspso at the moment i have three different methods available to me when logging in to skype my microsoft account my skype user livemyname my facebook accountthe only thing to be aware of is that the name of the microsoft account as presented on the account settings page in skype still is my old email removed for privacy and security mail address note that this is a presentation issue only someone thought that it was a good idea to save the original name of the microsoft account in the skype database and use that for presentation it is not used when logging on when you log on it will use the uid of you rmicrosoft account if it disturbs you you can always disconnect you rmicrosoft account from your skype account and reconnect it and you should see the current mail address associated with the microsoft account this is safe to do because you have at least one other method to log on nbspi hope that skype will amend their faq with this info i did enter into a second chat with skype support explaining what i díd to resolve the problem they failed to solve so there it at least  people at skype support who know how to resolve the problemnbspcheersandersnbsp",0

"301","updating to the latest skype version was a massive mistake that i intend to redact by going back to the last version whoever thought it was a good idea to harass users with a massive adspace column on the right that takes up almost a quarter of the screen when in fullscreen should be fired immediately yes i am aware that supposedly it goes away if you purchase a subscription or a minimal amount of credit but im hearing that even that doesnt always worknbspthis avertising column takes up roughly a quarter of my screen on a  x laptop display i shudder to think of how terrible it must scale on smaller or larger screens this results in a crimped text space that ends up making messages take up more vertical space and therefore limiting the amount of content that can be seen on screennbspnot everybody is using skype because we love its voip or video chat functionality most of the people i know are only using it because microsoft killed windows live messenger which was by far the superior instant messaging product even to this day features are still missing from skype that were in wlm nearly four years ago if not even further back all rambling aside what im saying is that for those of us that primarily use it for an instant messaging program purchasing skype creditsubscriptions is a waste of money for a feature we wouldnt even use i only occasionally do video chats or voice calls to shell out money just to remove the massive adspace column would be wastefulnbspi would like to appeal to the skype team to come up with some other solution for ad revenue placing this oversized advertising column only seems like an unethical tactic to gain money from people who might not need all the features skype has to offer like myself even reducing the size the column takes up by half would be a major improvement i understand that microsoft has to make money off the back of skype users that do not pay somehow but i refuse to support such unethical business tactics and so have blocked the gmsncom and appsskypecom advertising domains until such time as microsoft is ready to remove or reduce the size of the advertising columnnbspi implore those of you who feel the same way to come forward and make your opinions vocal lets let microsoft know that we will not stand for this abuse of their platform skype is rapidly declining in quality so we must let them know that the keys to a successful product is to listen to the customers complaints andor feedback",0
"302","why is it not a accessable feature to handle chat history in skype  i do know you can clear your history if you really want to but the way its done today a lot of users actually have to ask for directions on the internet and not just google it actual community posts so i wonder as a webdesigner and programmer what is my first priority in a advertisement driven service function what is function you ask well its accomplishing a task as unnoticable as possible while using as little energy and space while you do it that will always be the role of a function or an entire program atleast if you look at the code nbspso why is it not already a readily available function in the current user interface layout people are very fond of their private life and even though we all know the actual data isnt removed we can breath out that the wrong person doesnt get the opportunity to know every sentence we speak with people we know every time you leave a device in the open  nbspxxxxxx make it either a option to erase history on cykle on exit or even make it a xxxxxx keyboard shortcut but dont make it a borderl line advanced option setting that differs from client platform that must be the worst place to put it  nbsp  i do realise that because youve combined skype with facebook and more or less taken the role msn had you could be dealing with ownership and morale differencesnbspamongst yourselfs and that only makes this a very probably relativenbspfunction but not in any way hardimpossible i dont think i certainly hope that im alone in my opinions about the current solution for chatcall history and i hope inbspget atleast a fewnbspsupportivenbspcomments dare i hope for answers about future features in this post time will tell  nbsp  yours truly mjölnir  nbsp",0

"376","today i suddenly got upgraded to yet another new and useless version of skype which has further degraded the skype experience with no discernible benefitnbspi used note the past tense skype on a windows  dell machine with dual processor and  gbs of ramnbspfor the past two years i have watched as skypes performance has continued to degrade my computer to the point that i can no longer afford to have skype continuously running in the backgroundnbsp the application now grabs upwards of  mbs of system memory but it is clearly chewing up both system cpu cycles and bandwidth even when i am not on a skype callnbspabout two months ago when performance previouslynbspbecame intolerable i signed off of skype and closed the applicationnbsp my computer worked really great for the period i didnt have skype runningnbsp recently i needed some messaging service and started skype back upnbsp the performance problems returnednbspnbspthen today ms added insult to injury by further changing the interface in completely useless waysnbsp simple things became cumbersomenbsp file transfer didnt work properlynbsp but mostly the newest implementation made my computer unresponsivenbsp so once again i signed off of skypenbspnbspi signed off of skype and closed the application again today and regained the utility of my computernbsp now i am notifying my regular skype correspondents via email not to expect to find me regularly on skype any morenbsp i am also advising them that i am looking for an alternative and will let them know when i have identified the product  service we will use for future collaborationnbspit is unclear to me what the people at ms are smoking or just what delusions they are operating undernbsp but my computer does not exist for the purpose of ms tracking me and using an application to steal machine memory and cpu cycles from applications i really neednbspi still need a messaging servicenbsp it is clear that it cannot be skype because ms has no respect for its users and no interest in preserving user experience and satisfactionnbsp i am quite confident that i brought at least forty to fifty users to skype over the yearsnbsp once i identify and settle on an alternative i am quite confident that at least half of these will follow me to an alternative applicationnbsp i will probably bring at least as many other new users to whichever application i settle uponnbspnbspin case anyone at ms actually cares there are two rather fundamental flaws in the paradigm under which you are operating as to skypes evolutionnbspthe first flaw was that those who were previously using windows live messenger had similar messaging interests goals or objective to those using skypenbsp abandoning live messenger and forcing a migration of messenger users to skype was a horrible mistakenbsp those live messenger users i knew were totally dissatisfied with using skype and simply switched over to using yahoo messengernbsp they are not coming backnbspin the meantime ms makes the mistake that somehow it could widen the constituency for skype by adding features that look more like live messenger or yahoo messengernbsp but existing mature skype customers such as myself and everyone i communicate with have no interest in the nonsensical features that ms wants to add to make the skype experience more like windows live messenger or yahoonbsp rather than improving experience ms now alienates and estranges existing users and ultimately will drive enough of these away that the franchise will be completely destroyednbspsimilarly ms has made the mistake of believing that desktop tablet and handheld users have the same or substantially the same interestsnbsp of course in terms of user friendliness it is helpful for a product to work in intutive ways across multiple types of platformsnbsp but when a software vendor or service begins to alter a product that works and has an existing constituency to satisfy some new constituency on an alternative platform what mostly results in destruction of the existing franchisenbsp if ms wants to experiment with features that it thinks will appeal to hand held or tablet users that is just fine as long as ms doesnt mess with the features that work on a desktopnbspmost appalling is the fatware that has resulted from the desire to roll out new skype featuresnbspi do not want or need a mb application choking off resourcesnbsp i want a lean efficeint application that consumes no more than  mbs or so of system memory even if this means shedding  of the functionality that i never needed or usednbspms programmers seem to have forgotten how to write efficient code though there is little evidence thatnbspanyonenbsphas remembered how for more than a decadenbsp in seeking to marry live messenger and skype giving some legacy functionality ms has destroyed the core functionality most useful to both constituenciesnbsp performance had gotten worse and worsenbspthis problem is not unique ot menbsp when i communicated with my skype contacts that the reason i had signed off of skype was due to performance problems they related that they had experienced performance problems toonbsp when i suggested that they experiment with quitting skype to see if that resolved their performance issues there was a  correlation between those reporting problems and those who reported that these problems disappeared when they also shut down the applicationnbspfor those of you managers who dont remember this is called killing the goose that lays the golden eggsnbsp as you have continued to heap new functionality and features that no one uses or wants and merged two very different software products you simply destroyed thenbspcore functionality of your flagship productnbsp oh wellnbspnbspi simply cannot afford the productivity liability of having skype run in the background on my computer any morenbsp the degradation to system performance is now far too greatnbsp i cannot afford to have my computer become unresponsivenbsp i cannot afford to continuously reboot because skype is causing problems with other applicationsnbspneither can i afford to spend hours monitoring forums such as this one searching for solutions to problems that ought never to have arisen because new features have been rolled out which degrade performance and create stability and usability issuesnbsp i want an application that i dont have to spend even fifteen minutes a month to relearn or understandbye now",0

"391","has it occurred to you evil microsoft scumbag developers that skype might be used only on occasion and in emergencies how can that be possible when a new version has to be downloaded every time one needs to connect and take the time to install it while on bad connections in airports etc and a need for urgency is required all versions of skype used to connect without hindrances now i can not connect simply because i moved the folder of my skype portable to another file folder has it occurred to you that skype used to be used as a cross cultural cross continental platform for reaching out to people from all over the world people would use it while traveling studying abroad working abroad or simply from hotels and airports when they needed a ride stop tracking our ips and requiring a consistent ip to sign in people would also use skype to meet people cross internationally that was the most exciting thing about the internet when it came about contacting people in other countries and far far away and making friends online i was absolutely amazed when i once could practice my language skills with someone in a country thousands of miles away how can that be possible when the default settings are to restrict settings to people on your contact list already yet paradoxically anyone can riskily connect to your computer with a voice call what kind of tyranny of the default is that has it occurred to you that the first level of security online is anonymity online thats why since the advent of the internet people have used handles screen names and nicks stop asking for peoples personal information has it occurred to you that with touch screens these days and the accidentally hit caps locks keys that someone might accidentally enter their passwords incorrectly more than three times this is especially the case for the elderly stop locking people out of their accounts if they incorrectly enter their passwords more than three times security is using anonymity and strong passwords make it  times at the least so knock it off there was a time when software makers strove to make software easier to use more userfriendly remember that term and more accessible get back to it make skype more universally accessible remove all the restrictions to the connections except of course tsl and ssl allow people to connect to each other safely and anonymously and securely without being snooped upon like the sick creepy stalkers that you are allow people to connect using all versions or at least since version  to connect to one another",0

"418","hii think a vital point to all messenger interfaces is the ability to use good emoticonssmiliesemoji for people to express themselves in more fun ways before there was skype there was msn messenger and it cant be denied that the biggest misery in the loss of msn was the fact that there would no longer be a good messenger interface that provided the same function to add your own custom emoticons and after having no choice but to move onto skype i was greatly disappointed by the poor and limited emoticons available to be quite honest they suck so much that neither i or any of my friends even use them it used to be really different and fun to be able to use your own custom emoticons because youd have your own person collection of them that you could send to anyone anywhere it never ever got boring and i feel this is something that skype greatly lacksnbspperhaps this is something that is difficult to accomplish in skype and perhaps requires a lot of software work however i feel it would really be worth all the effort to add this feature and surely will benefit you and all skype users happier with their skype experiencesi would not believe that this is something that cant be done because msn messenger was capable of having it and i believe skype is ought to be far more advanced however as of yet nbspi still think skype is inferior to msn mainly due to this reasonat least please add this function for pclaptop if it is too hard for mobile although if facebook is able to display advanced smileys in its messenger then again im not sure why skype couldntthank you for reading and i sincerely hope this suggestion will be considered and that youll add this function nbsp                                                                                                                                              status    duplicate                thank you for the feedback custom emoticons are being considered there are other custom emoticon requests such as  if other users would like this added please add your kudos there",0
