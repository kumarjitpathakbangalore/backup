"2","skype as long as its installed  logged on becomes a background service i do like the look of the current version but i do hate how it runs there was a problem regarding it running in background in the past where despite exiting the application through signing off with automatic signon enabled the app would reopen itself if someone called you let alone even sent you a file   now signing off literally logging off is the only way to stop the app the biggest downside is having to log in again if you swipe away the app from your recent apps display the sticky notification still remains you can turn it off but sometimes you dont want that option off when skype is actually running you cant win you just cant win   when the app is off the app should be off and shouldnt display calls of files when the app is swiped the app should also be off   there should also be an option to exit the app instead of signing off exiting the app and signing off of the app are two different things period","anger","negative"

"288","wow in all my years of being online and ive been online since the preinternet bulletin board days skype support has to rank as one of the most exasperating stressinducing userunfriendly experiences ive ever hadi recently got an email from skype saying basically hey you havent logged in to your account for a while since i was unsure as to the status of my account since microsoft took over i wanted to confirm a few things so i go to the website and click on forgot your skype name the site sends me a special token in order to view my username but the token proves to be invalid clicking the link in the email from skype brings me to an error page declaring that this is an invalid security token or something very similar trying manual entry of the code causes the same errorthen i try the forgot password link three times every single time skype declares that the codetoken that they have just sent me seconds ago is invalid so after wasting  minutes or so with this nonsense i head over to skypes support page to see if anybody can tell me whats going on a quick search of the community forum brings up dozens of relevant posts going back to  in which peopleunderstandably suffering from various degrees of frustrationdescribe the exact problem im having i also discover that apparently nobody from skype actually reads or cares about the forum posts because not a single one of these people were given either an explanation or a resolution to their problem which is unconscionable considering that this problem with passwordreset tokens has been going on for at least  yearsi then try contacting support directly but discover that in order to do that you have to log in to skype really did the wizards at skype ever consider that some of the people who need support could have a problem which prevents them from logging in to skype in the first place maybe the system is intentionally designed this way so that skype doesnt have to bother replying to these people maybe some guy brought this up at one of the development meetings and the reply was mmm what happens when they cant log in you ask welli guessumscrew em and then everybody had a good laughi had to create a new additional skype account just to post this a ridiculously convoluted waste of time for someone who just wants a simple answer i guess im also an idiot for even bothering to post this because judging from all the other identical posts which went completely unanswered or given useless answers this one will probably be ignored as wellbut anyway here goes nothingquestion how does one retrieve their password and access their skype account when the passwordreset system does not properly functionif the answer is get in touch with customer service then the question becomes how do you contact customer service without logging in to your account which cannot be donenbspsoin the slim chance that somebody with the ability or desire to help actually reads this and offers a viable solution then i sincerely thank you in advance","anger","negative"

"421","hello everyone i have serveral problems on my skype i use skype on windows  i have had these problems once or twice and i usually fixed it by simply deleting the program and redownloading it i got the issue again and i dont mostly everything to fix it but nothing works the issue or problem im having is pretty simple i cant call message or change my status everytime i message someone something it just never sends and the loading thing just keeps circuling around and around and never sends when i send a picture all it say is failed to uploadsend when i try calling the call never rings and just stays there forever and i cant end it i usually have to restart my skype to get out of it the last issue is changing my status usually when i change my status the program doesnt do anything basically those are my issues for my skype i saw some other people having the similar issue some helping people gave them some advice i followed the steps to fix the problem i tried first by doing the press the windows key and r and type in appdata then it said to rename the skype folder oldskype i did that but sadly another problem occured it said you cannot rename because this file is open in another programplace i dont know where because i already closed my skype and quit out of it the second thing i did was to press the windows key again and to click r and to type in tempskype next i had to delete a folder called dbtemp the same problem again occurred  you cannot delete this folder because the file is open in another programplace i decided to rethink and get the modern skype for windows the original problem was still there i cant call or message or change my status on either of my skypes skype desktop and modern windows skype i gave a thought and said what if it was my computer i denied that thought because my internet browser and regular pc games still worked and operated just fine then i said what if its just my skype profile itself  i also countered that thought by the fact i was still able to use skype on my mobile phone this isssue is really a pain killer i use skype for communicating with friends and i cannot convince them to use another program instead of skype and using my mobile device while playing pc games on my computer makes my games lag and crash please i request assisstance and help from anybodynbsp                                                                                                                  solved                          go to solution","sadness","neutral"
