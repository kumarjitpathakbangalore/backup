AppleiTunesStore,20909,A solution to fix broken notifications .. It worked,After attempting to fix my 8 months of broken push notifications with all suggestions I thought I try one more thing I haven't tried & it worked !!  Notifications problem gone .   I recommend to try it . I just figured out when your all your notifications are switched on but your Skype contact chat screen notification turned off your contacts will not get a notification from you at all & visa versa !!  After establishing all phone & in app in your Skype profile are ALL switched ON Go to each of your Skype contacts & within the chat screen go to the chat notifications & see if turned on . Tap the three dots on the bottom right hand corner . Chat menu comes up . Tap notifications . Turn it on .  Now contact each of your Skype contacts & ask them to go into each of their contacts chat screen & switch notifications on .  Once I got each of my Skype contacts to check their chat sessions & had them switch notifications on the problem went away .    Give it a try it it would be nice for feedback it worked .   Good luck ! Hope it works for everyone!
GooglePlayStore,40858,"Skype, as long as it's installed & logged on, becomes a background service.","Skype, as long as it's installed & logged on, becomes a background service. I do like the look of the current version, but I do hate how it runs. There was a problem regarding it running in background in the past where, despite exiting the application through signing off with automatic sign-on enabled, the app would re-open itself if someone called you... let alone even sent you a file.   Now, signing off (literally logging off) is the only way to stop the app. The biggest downside is having to log in AGAIN. If you swipe away the app from your recent apps display, the sticky notification still remains. You can turn it off, but sometimes, you don't want that option off when Skype is ACTUALLY running. You can't win! You just can't win!   When the app is off, the app should be off and shouldn't display calls of files.. When the app is swiped, the app should also be off.   There should also be an option to EXIT the app instead of signing off. EXITING the app and SIGNING OFF of the app are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. Period."
MicrosoftTechNetForum,98997,Lync 2013 client systems installed Skype for business client windows updates with strange results!?!?!,"Good evening,  In an automated updates deployment workstations that Office 2013 (Lync client) installed actually installed updates that were intended for Skype for Business 2015 client! None of these workstations had had the KB2889923 update installed that actually updates   from Lync client to SFB2015 client and were all functioning as traditional Lync clients.    However, they all installed update KB3039779 that is security update for the SFB2015 client? This resulted in some strange behaviour. The Lync icons changed to SFB2015 icons, Lync within the start-menu changed to SFB2015 yet the UI remained the same - the   Lync client UI not SFB2015! I've uninstalled the KB3039779 from the affected workstations and everything is now back to normal. Even stranger, this didn't affect all of our workstations but only a small number - all utilising the same version of the Lync client.   The updates were deployed through an automated SCCM update.   Does anyone have any idea what has occurred here? I'm completely baffled. I'm also concerned that this could reoccur in future. The changes were only subtle and so we didn't notice them on our test deployment systems.    Thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this post.     M Tipler"

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99142,Query: Lync Requirements to make a Phone Call via Desktop or Desk phone or Smart phone,"Hi Remus, I'm not entirely clear on all your questions but;  1.) Lync doesn't have any dependency on an existing VOIP solution. It's an enterprise grade Unified Communication product (a suite of services), and as part of that suite is capable of acting as a complete VOIP telephony solution in its own right. Providing   you deploy the required Lync roles / servers and supporting components (SBCs, SIP trunks etc.), then you can connect your Lync environment to the PSTN and use it as a complete replacement for any telephony system. That said, if you do have an existing PBX   / telephony system that you would like to retain and have co-existence with, then that possible as well. Regarding soft clients, the Lync desktop client is just one type of endpoint that a user can make and receive calls on, they might also use desk phones,   conferencing devices, or qualified contact centre products to name a few.  2.) As mentioned above, you can't use another vendors softphone with Lync, you'd use the MSFT Lync client software.    3.) Lync works natively with Microsoft Exchange. Calendar integration, conversation history etc. all work out the box providing Exchange is healthy and configured correctly. If you were to use Exchange 2010 with Lync as a telephony solution, then it will   also handle your voicemail functionality - this requires the deployment and configuration of the Unified Messaging role on the Exchange servers(s)  4.) Unfortunately I'm not over familiar with BCM, and can't vouch for any enhancements or benefits that you might gain. Your call log history is saved directly in outlook via Exchange, but I'm not sure you'll get any click to call functionality (which is   what I think you're getting at there).

External settings of Edge 2013 servers have been define With different name (Access,WEB and AV) and DNS (internally and externally) is pointing to New 2013 servers (via KEMP and TMG).  ATM 2013 topology is using edge2010 server.  Seems like we have two options for replacing Edge servers,one is Rip and replace and the other one is side by side transition.  We would like to do rip and replace so we can keep old simple urls (so that we dont have to send notice to external partners about Our New Access edge info) and using 2013 edge servers for federation and keep users on 2010 servers,then move them in   a controlled way.    What is the best way to do this?    Thanks!        Please mark as helpful if you find my contribution useful or as an answer if it does answer your question.

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99271,Lync Phone Edition Polycom CX600 Sign Out/In many times throughout the day,"Check this out - https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/d9cf0adf-cabf-423a-b5ce-445a94abc682/lync-phone-edition-constant-sign-in-and-out-for-some-users?forum=ocsclients    If SCHANNEL is sending a truncated list of trusted root certificate authorities to the Lync phone edition client during the TLS/SSL handshake process, this can explain the symptoms.    To check this look in your Lync FE servers system event log for the following warning:    ----  EVENT ID: 36885    When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities   that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.  ----    The easiest way to fix this is to configure SCHANNEL on the Lync FE's not to send this list:    1. Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey -     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL    3. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD Value.  4. Type SendTrustedIssuerList, and then press ENTER to name the registry entry.  5. Right-click SendTrustedIssuerList, and then click Modify.  6. In the Value data box, type 0 if that value is not already displayed, and then click OK.  7. Exit Registry Editor.    You shouldn't need to reboot the server for this to take effect.    Hope this helps!!

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99344,"Steps to deploy Lync for users who own Office 365 E1/E2 licenses, but don’t have Office 365 E3, using Office Deployment tool.","After many hours of debugging with Microsoft support the system to install the Lync Client silently can be done with a SINGLE LINE command.  The steps to take are below. It should be an easy next step to put this as GPO installation since   it is a simple command.  Comments appreciated.    side question: Why is there no Lync 2013 or Lync Office 365 forum?    Basic steps to deploy Lync for users who own Office 365 E2 licenses, but don’t have Office 365 E3, using Office Deployment tool.  This also applies for other Office 365 service types where the full office suite download is not included.  In April 2015 This was impossible to find online and not know by the Lync support team.  Steps are:    Download the Office deployment tool from  http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=36778 and extract it to a folder. For this   example we will use the \\server\sharename  location.  Extracting it creates a setup.exe file and it show a sample XML file.  2. Create XML file and give it a name such as LyncEntryRetail.xml  Note: The key is the productID that has to be the “LyncEntryRetail”. Other product IDs will download a version that needs another office 365 license. The productID “LyncRetail” needs an E3 license of Office 365.    <Configuration>    <Add SourcePath=""\\server\sharename"" OfficeClientEdition=""32"" >      <Product ID=""LyncEntryRetail"">        <Language ID=""en-us"" />      </Product>    </Add>     </Configuration>  3. From the folder where you extracted the Office deployment tool, run the following command on the command prompt to download the source files and store them on the shared drive:    (on single line)  Setup.exe /download LyncEntryRetail.xml    (This is the name of the XML file created above)    One can also run the same on a server share by using UNC path names such as  (on single line)  \\servername\sharename\Setup.exe /download  \\servername\sharename\LyncEntryRetail.xml    (This is the name of the XML file created above)  4. Run the following command on the command prompt on a machine where you want to install the software: (on single line)  \\servername\sharename\Setup.exe /configure  \\servername\sharename\LyncEntryRetail.xml    (This is the name of the XML file created above)  Once you are comfortable that it all works, you may want to edit the XML file if you want to have silent installation and add the following lines.    <Display Level=""None"" AcceptEULA=""TRUE"" />       <Property Name=""AUTOACTIVATE"" Value=""1"" />       Regards   Bart    Bart Louwagie"
MicrosoftTechNetForum,99375,Blocking Lync from Searching Outlook Contact Folders,"We all know Lync has a great feature that it can search contacts from Outlook Contact Folders. But sometimes, we do not want the Lync Client to search Contacts   from some specific Outlook Contact Folders.    [Requirements]  For example, in my scenario, I have personal contacts defined in Outlook and my Lync client shows both Lync enabled users and Outlook contacts in search results.  (There are three Contacts in two Contact Folders, TestUser2 in Contacts Folder, TestUser1 and TestUser3 in CS Folder)                Yes, everything works well. But now I do not want it to search Contacts from the CS folder.              [Solution]  For this example, I will create a new client policy and configure it to not search the Outlook “CS” folder. I create the policy by running:  New-CsClientPolicy –Identity “ExcludeOutlookContactFolder” –ExcludedContactFolders “CS”          Then assign the policy to the user “LyncDemo2” by running:  Grant-CsClientPolicy –Identity LyncDemo2 -PolicyName “ExcludeOutlookContactFolder”            Run Get-CsUser command to check if the policy is assigned to the User.          After the user receives the new client policy, the same search will not show the Outlook contacts from “CS” folder:        Important: Please make sure both the Outlook and Lync client are up   to date. In my testing, I found it might not work with some previous versions.

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99424,Lync 2013 No video in preview window nor in video conference call,"Hi,  I am using the GPU Intensity Pro on a 64Bit Windows 7 Enterprise HP Desktop Computer at work together with Sony HDR-CX570 camcorder.  The Microsoft Lync 2013 Basic Client 32-bit version 15.0.4.4701.1000 is used with the latest patch KB2956174.  I have connected a video signal to the Intensity Pro and I would like to use this input in Microsoft Lync 2013 for video calls. BUT I have NO VIDEO signal in Lync.   In Lync Options->Video Device settings->Select the camera you want to use for video calls (Declink Video Camera is used). The preview window in Lync is always black i.e. there is no video input signal from camera. In video conference   call there is NO VIDEO, too. The GPU drivers used are latest Blackmagic's Desktop Video 10.4 drivers for the Intensity Pro.    The Intensity Pro drivers are working properly because when I use the Blackmagic Media Express utility I can see preview video from the camera and I can change the video resolutions through graphic cards properties   – no problem at all. I use the direct input from a camera and it works.  The Intensity Pro is shown in the Device Manager and no errors at all.    Within Lync I can access to change the video settings but the changes are not accepted and the small screen is still black. So please let me know how to fix the problem.  Best regards,  Robert"

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99543,Update databases after Core Component Cumulative Update on Lync Server 2010 Standard,"Hello,   I've installed several Cumulative Updates in the past on my Lync 2010 Server through Windows Updates but I just found out that I have to update the Lync Server databases. I've never updated the database after I've installed the Cumulative Updates. In how   much trouble am I? I haven't had any issues with my Lync Servers everything seems to be working fine so far.   Now I have another cumulative update in my Windows Update queue and I want to make things right this time and update the Lync database as well. I know I have to run the following cmdlet:   Install-CsDatabase -Update -ConfiguredDatabases -SqlServerFqdn <EEBE.Fqdn> -UseDefaultSqlPaths  Probably a dumb question but here it goes: My Lync databases are hosted in my SQL server, they are not on the Lync server. Due to this fact, do I have to change the -SqlServerFdqn parameter from EEBE.fqdn to my SQL server's FQDN? And do I run the cmdlet   from my Lync front-end server or from my SQL server?   Will it cause too much trouble to update the databases this late in the game?   Thanks!"

We found that the following registry key:   [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}\2.b]    ""PrimaryInteropAssemblyName""=""Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71E9BCE111E9429C""    is created by the Lync 2013 installer (and some subsequent patches). But PowerPoint v15 (i.e. PowerPoint 2013) does not exist on the PCs, only PowerPoint 2010 is installed. (Other registry keys may be created that affect other components, but we've   been concerned only with PowerPoint).    The Office v14 (i.e. Office 2010) equivalent registry keys have much more information:     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}\2.a]    ""PrimaryInteropAssemblyName""=""Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71E9BCE111E9429C""    @=""Microsoft PowerPoint 14.0 Object Library""   [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}\2.a\0]   [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}\2.a\0\win32]    @=""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\Office14\\MSPPT.OLB""   [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}\2.a\FLAGS]    @=""0""   [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}\2.a\HELPDIR]    @=""[{91493440-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}]""    It seems that the Lync 2013 installer is erroneously adding the ""2.b"" key assuming that PowerPoint 2013 is installed. I discovered the following the patches also add the ""2.b"" key on PCs with Lync 2013 and Office 2010 installed:    KB3039779 : MS15-044: Description of the security update for Lync 2013 (Skype for Business): May 12, 2015 - [3039779]KB2986244 : May 12, 2015, update for OneDrive for Business (KB2986244)KB2986246 : May 12, 2015, update for Project 2013 (KB2986246)KB2880487 : April 14, 2015 update for Office 2013 (KB2880487)KB2965277 : May 12, 2015, update for Office 2013 (KB2965277)KB2975901 : May 12, 2015, update for OneNote 2013 (KB2975901)    However about 16 or so other Office 2013 patches that get applied to these Office 2010 with Lync 2013 PCs do not add the ""2.b"" registry key e.g.  KB3039799 - Update for Outlook 2013 & KB2975808 - Update for Microsoft 2013.    I believe this is a bug in the Lync installer and six patches described above.  After we delete the ""2.b"" registry key, the application works fine. How can this be submitted to the Office team?    We haven't yet done full regression testing for the Office 2013 suite, so we're at risk of breaking other legacy applications if we the upgrade PCs now to Office 2013.

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99696,Lync 2013 client systems installed Skype for business client windows updates with strange results!?!?!,"Hi Matt,  The May update release on Tuesday just gone will have updated your clients to Skype4B, even if you neglected to apply the April one as you did. A few people who are not looking to expose their users to any Skype4B branding yet have been caught out by this   second punch as it were.  What you experienced however is completely normal for an on-premises Lync deployment. When you apply these updates, the clients are updated to Skype4B under the hood, but the GUI will stay as the Lync interface until such time the administrator enables the   SkypeUI to true in the client policies of their users. However as you've eluded to, although the GUI stays as Lync, there are some subtle changes that may confuse users if the correct level of awareness doesn't exist; the system tray will change to a Skype   icon, you'll have difference sounds and ringtones, the one click join meeting experience uses Skype working instead of Lync, just to name a few.  In contrast, office 365 users are quite the opposite, and the default experience for them will to be faced with a new Skype GUI unless their admins define otherwise.  As for why some of your users were unaffected, there must have been some minor inconsistences in the level / number of updates across the user populous.  Get some awareness actions on the go and adopt ;) resistance is futile =)  Kind regards  Ben    Note: If you find a post informative, please mark it so using the arrow to the left.

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99709,Lync 2011 (Mac) + Outlook 2011 (Mac) = High CPU Activity,"Let's set the groundwork:  Mac OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion)  ?Lync 2011 14.0.4 (also seen with 14.0.2 and 14.0.3)  Outlook 2011 14.3.1    When Lync and Outlook are run concurrently Lync 2011 will, after a brief period of time, report extremely high CPU utilization (over 150% CPU on a Core i7 CPU). At the same time, Outlook 2011 will report high (40% and above) CPU usage. Threads used by Lync   2011 will go up to about 85 (from 24 when running by itself).    During this time Lync will remain responsive, but Outlook 2011 will be effectively unresponsive (command-Q will quit Outlook after a delay of 10-15 seconds). Inspecting the Lync or Outlook process via Activity Monitor will show abnormally large numbers of Mach   Messages, System Calls, and Context Switches.    Quitting either Lync or Outlook will return CPU utilization and other indicators to normal levels.    This behavior has been going on for several months. It's not a crashing issue, but it makes it impossible to run Lync and Outlook at the same time.    I've deleted and rebuilt ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/. I've done a clean re-install of Mac OS X on my Mac. I've confirmed that another user in my company is seeing the same behavior on their computer. I've also read the other threads here: this is not the   ""I had 10K messages in my Deleted Items folder"" error - I've long cleared that. My total Exchange Server storage is 610MB, with the largest single subfolder at 100MB (1,569 items). Inbox is typically between 75 and 300 items, with no subfolders.    No other processes report abnormal CPU usage during this time. This includes Microsoft Database Daemon and mdworker (Spotlight). I am using Activity Monitor to view All Processes, not simply My Processes.    This is not transitory. Once the high CPU utilization phase begins, it's been seen to go on for as long as 20 minutes (at which point I gave up and quit processes) - so it's not just a ""spike"" from an indexing process.  I had high hopes for the Lync 14.0.4 update, but the issue remains. Any assistance would be appreciated."

Computers are in the AD Forest not in the resource forest  The authentication used to sign in to lync is NTLM. so when the users clicks on the save Password flag , after inserting the user and Password credentials to Login, you get the cerfiicate issued from communication Servers stored in the user   personal certficate store ,which will expire by Default after 180 days. What I've read in the documents found around the web, is that the certificate should be automatically renewed starting from one month to the expiration date and also   that  you should receive a nofication about the certificate is going to expire one week before expiration. In my Situation it doesn't happen, I found out that the cerficate expires without notifying and renewing, and I have to manually delete it,otherwise   lync Clients won't sign-in, it remains stuck on the sign in Screen... After removing the expired certificate I was able to sign-in putting the credentials again, and checking the save Password I saw that I got a new certificate issued by communication Server   that will expire after 180 days  can someone please explains what is Happening? Is there a way to avoid this, or to resolve the issue? Can  someone tell me how to use a PS script to get a list of user certificates that will expire in a certain date?  Many thanks"

I have noticed that if I have started a Lync conversation with someone during the entire day that it stores multiple copies of the conversation in my Conversation history folder. Let me explain with an example.  I talked with John Doe from 8am-9am uninterrupted. It will store that convo into the history folder with a size of 100kb.  I come back to John around 10am and talked to him for another hour uninterrupted. Outlook will then combine the earlier conversation and append this convo to the bottom and save it in the history folder with a size of (100+ 70 = 170kb). However,   if you look at the history folder, it will still save the first conversation (100kb) and have this new convo as well (170kb). It does not cleanup the first conversation.  The cycle continues throughout the day where I have multiple conversations with John and they get stored in multiple times without removing the old one. End result we get a potentially large # of conversations stored chewing up a lot of space.  I have been manually doing the cleanup of duplicate messages to free up space. This leads me to the question on whether if there is a cleanup mechanism or setting I need to enable so that I can avoid this manual work?  Your response(s) are greatly appreciated.  -Sunny"

MicrosoftTechNetForum,99828,Query: Lync Requirements to make a Phone Call via Desktop or Desk phone or Smart phone,"Hi All,  I am doing a research on seeing the feasibility of a VOIP solution for our company, but as I came across MS Lync, it seems to have additional features like Making phone calls through it, Instant Messaging, Conferencing, Outlook integration - MakingPhone   Calls by clicking the contacts number and all.  Now I see that, after going through multiple documentations and wherever I could find more detailed information on Lync and telephony, I have the following questions:  1) Do we need a VOIP solution in place that will help us connect to any phone number, from what it looks like we do from a desktop, seems like it will link up with the VOIP soft client for the call.  2) If we do need a VOIP solution in place, will it work with any VOIP provider or do they have to have a specific VOIP customization with Lync (Soft Phone Client integration). Any reference links if possible.  3) Outlook Integration with Lync: I had a check on this reference, it seems that it does a RPC call, thus I take it we wont have to modify our Exchange Server 2010 to allow integration with Lync.  4) Business Contact Manager (BCM) 2010 integration with Lync 2010: I searched as much as I could regarding this, where Phone Call option is available in BCM, but as I take it that it works for Dial-up Modems only, but with Lync along with VOIP would   be able to initiate the call so that it could be tracked during the process as per log history.

MicrosoftTechNetForum,100125,How to disable saving feature Powerpoint Presentation on Lync 2010,"Hi John,  You can disable the ability for users to upload PPT content by setting the -AllowOfficeContent parameter to $False in the conferencing policy that is applied to that user(s). This will remove the upload PPT content icon completely and prevent uploading.  Regarding your first question; By default, 'presenters' can download PPT content. In turn, anyone from your corporate network is designated as a presenter - this is why all internal users can download PPT content. If you want to prevent this, then you need   to change the default meetingconfiguration policy. In the meetingconfigurationpolicy there is a parameter name 'DesignateAsPresenter' which will be set to Company by default. You'd need to change this value to 'none' if you wanted to prevent people downloading   PPT content - This would however apply to other shared content such as whiteboards, and there's also nothing to stop the meeting organiser change this setting during the meeting. It's merely the default setting that you'd change using this method.  Kind regards  Ben    Note: If you find a post informative, please mark it so using the arrow to the left. If it answers a question you've asked, please mark the thread as answered to aid others when they're looking for solutions to similar problems or queries."

We've got a Lync 2010 pool for internal use only without an edge server. It's been working fine for about a year, and conferencing used to work fine.

Office365Community,99858,Skype for Business - Sharing Documents - Non-Archived Features,"Hi Mark,  Question 1: Basically, if I go through all my users 250 at a time to make sure the third box is unchecked, all my users will have the exact same setup on the other two boxes.  Is this correct?  Is there a work around so that I can make sure all users have the third checkbox unchecked while maintaining their other settings?  I have done some tests. For example, there are five users. (1) User A and B (only check Record and non-archived)(2) User C and D (only check Allow and non-archived)(3) User E (only check non-archived)  When you choose these five users at one time, you only uncheck non-archived box and didn’t change anything about other two boxes (Record and Allow). After that, the boxes of non-archived are unchecked for all users and other settings (Record and Allow) keep the original settings.  Question 2: what happens if the recording feature is checked in the admin portal for an E1 licensed user?  Also, does Skype for Business eliminate the difference between Lync Basic and Lync full, making the recording feature a non-issue?  Since E3 users use Skype for Business (Lync) full version, the recording feature is available for them. Normally, E1 users use Skype for Business (Lync) basic version and the recording feature is not available for the basic version. If the recording feature is checked in the admin portal for an E1 licensed user, nothing will happen due to the Skype for Business clients’ version.  Question 3: Also, does Skype for Business eliminate the difference between Lync Basic and Lync full, making the recording feature a non-issue?  Skype for Business (Lync) Basic provides all the basic functionality of the full version of Skype for Business. However, if you want to use any of the following features, you will need to upgrade to Lync 2013:  1) Advanced call features (not available with all Office 365 subscriptions); advanced call features include team ring, call forwarding, simultaneous ring, voice mail, call park, call delegation, response groups, and remote call control2) Calendar delegation3) Gallery video view4) OneNote sharing5) Recording6) Skill search (not available with Office 365)7) Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) (not available with Office 365)  You can click the link below to know more information:  What is Lync Basic?

SkypeCommunityHistory,613,Keep getting stranger asking me to acept them on m...,"Today it was crazy. Every minute I was getting requests from strangers to accept them on my contact list because they liked my profile.&nbsp; There is nothing in my profile except my picture which is some how connected to my FaceBook profile picture because that is the only place I have a picture of myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all my privacy settings it's checked marked that only people in my contacts can send me messages. After about 15 people asking me to accept them I stared Banning them in hopes that would stop the messages but it hasn't.&nbsp;Also in the past I had another stranger sending messages asking me how I was a couple times a day and there was no way I could block him. That too was very annoing. After&nbsp;a month he finally stopped. I never answered any of his messages. So I want to know&nbsp;what&nbsp;I can do to stop strangers from sending me messages and to stop people from requesting I accept them on my contact list. Having my privacy setting checked marked to only recieve messages from people in my contact list is not blocking&nbsp;them from sending me messages or requesting me to accept them on my contact list. It's very, very annoining.....

It isnt the other person cause I have tried with their mic muted and even their mic unplugged. I can even go into test call and when I talk I can hear myself. It is like the mic is picking up me talk and playing it back twice but once with a delay! How do I fix this? My sound is not too high, I have made sure that I am using the right device (Turtle beach Audio) and I am using an Amigo II adapter to turn mic and speaker into USB. I have always used the Amigo II so I dont think that is the problem.&nbsp;Edit: It only occurs when the call is active! It does not occur when in the calling process or when not in skype. Can go on TS just fine without the echo. It is like skype is playing back what I am saying so I can hear myself but doing it with a delay. Kind of like how my headset is built to be able to hear myself but instantly because it has noise cancellation. (Hard to talk when you cant hear yourself)"

SkypeCommunityHistory,27577,Why block version 4.2.0.187? The best version ther...,"So, I have been using Skype version 6.x for a while now when Skype automaticly updated from 4.2.0.187 a while back. I am very unpleased with the newer versions of Skype, all of my friends has also been very unpleased with the newer versions compared to 4.2.0.187. I decided today that I would try and go back to version 4.2.0.187 as I find it very superior to any other Skype version only to find you have blocked anyone from signin in to older versions of Skype. I mean sure, update the Skype client and make it worse, remove features and whatever you want, but don't stop other users from using the version they want.&nbsp;It seems like Skype is turning worse with every update it gets. The call UI is so **bleep** bad I don't even understand how you came up with it. When I'm a call, I can only see the people that are in the call and not the people that aren't connected to the call but are in the group. I can't see if a person has parked the call or not either. And if I want to call a person that's not connected but are in the group, there are now 4 clicks, it was previously 1 (that's a really bad thing to user experience) and it's more cluttered. Also, if there are few persons in the call (edit: just tested, if the portraits take up the whole height rather), when I want to disconnect them from the call I need to click the red button under their portrait but the menu that pops up when I hover the call blocks it so I need to resize the call to be able to kick them. It's really unbelievable that Skype has gotten this much worse, making it more cluttered and less user friendly.&nbsp;I have not tested the latest version, 7.x or whatever it is but some of my friends have and they all say it's worse than before. And before anyone says I can't complain about newer versions before testing the latest I don't care. I took them 3 years to get from the version I was on to the one I am on now and they didn't improve one single thing, they just made it worse so I'll doubt they made it better in any later versions.&nbsp;TL;DR Skype 4.2.0.187 is the best version of Skype and every version after is far worse and M$ blocks older versions."

When you reinstall it, whatever version, it draws from the data there so your stuck command, which is on your machine NOT on Skype's servers, never goes away.&nbsp;I had this happen with one person I have up on chat for business all the time. He was NEVER offline. First time was on my office computer. I sent 2 messages that showed the spinning arrows and ""Not delivered yet"". Yet, in this case, means forever. Anyway, my Skype on my phone and another instance of it on my home computer were unaffected. Same account, 3 places, problem was only on one computer so it was on that computer NOT on Skype.&nbsp;To be safe, if you want to uninstall, then reinstall it, go for it (I did. Not sure if the combo fixed it or what) Do it this way:Uninstall Skypego to %username%/AppData/Roaming and in that directory you will see a Skype folder. Delete it.Then reinstall Skype&nbsp;You will have to put your username and password in again, and repost your picture, and the program will recreate that directory on your computer but the hung messages will be gone.&nbsp;Oh and your entire history with everyone else, including the person your messages got hung on, will still be there."

Why is that? It's not like as though Skype is trying to save me money or bandwidth usage. After all, if Skype happens to be running but not the forefront application there is no indication whatsoever that the application is running. If you have your phone show the list of running or recent applications Skype will not be there. It's also not in your status bar. Often times I have been out and about away from Wi-Fi only to hear someone trying to contact me on Skype and that is how I realize that all this time Skype has been eating my data plan. So this is really a gripe on multiple fronts. The part about hanging up just because Skype isn't the forefront application during call set up, also it's about Skype basically trying to hide itself and keep me misinformed as to its running status.&nbsp;I'm sure I'll get all kinds of messages from people who live on this forum and cheerlead for Skype/MS because they get gold stars or badges, or maybe they even get paid by Microsoft who knows. But there seems to be people on this forum that jump all over anyone who has anything negative to say about Skype. I suppose these are people who have nothing better to do when there's not a Star Trek&nbsp; convention in town.&nbsp;In any case, these are real gripes about real problems that Skype has. I have seen nothing good happen to Skype since Microsoft bought it.&nbsp; Basically Microsoft has done for Skype what they've done for Windows, which is really just abuse their position as the major player in the market knowing that people have to take whatever they dish out. I so much wish someone else would hurry up with a good alternative to Skype."
SkypeCommunityHistory,27968,"It's written in simple language, but it's complica...","Skype is written in simple language, but it is not easy to navigate. For example, it will say that I have a voice message, but it won't say how to find it or where it is. We have to log on on two seperate pages, one is for our account, the other is for contacts and calling. I had an old computer, and it was easier to access Skype functions, find contacts, and initiate conversations. I got a new computer, and now it is more complicated for some reason. For example, I will click on the button for ""leave feedback"" but when the box opens the cursor will not appear. It's just a blank box. When I want to chat with friends, I have to fumble around to find things because it is not specifically spelled out. There's not chat button visible when I click on a contact. I often find things haphazardly. Take Facebook for example, if you want to chat with a friend of leave a message, all you need to do is click on that friend's name and it has words that say leave a message. There is also a chat icon and box right there. You don't have to search around in the dark. Maybe Skype is easy for people who are tech saavy and can just find things, but for me, it's not simple. Some things are simple like post a photo, use this photo, change photo, but other things simply are not visible."

SkypeCommunityHistory,28122,Why doesn't Skype not close when you click the X b...,"Would you prefer that they removed the x, and just kept the two others? Skype and may other programs designed to run in systray (MS Outlook, Blizzards battle.net app, Steam client, MS skydrive, Spotify, Nvidia geeforce experience, ATI CCC, most anti virus software) and litterallly hundred more programs work like this.&nbsp;The minimize button minimizes (taskbar ... bahh), the Small/large view button does exactly that, AND the x sends to tray. Skype is allways in tray, so rightclick, quit IS the proper way (unless using menus), to close&nbsp;Skype and the above mentioned programs.&nbsp;This is not new, nor spesific to Skype, it takes about 4 seconds to learn. Allthough many apps have options for quit behaviour (Skype does have quit in the menu aswell, that actually means quit), Skype does not.&nbsp;As for the last posters second issue, the buttons does not work have had a lot of attension here, a search should give you a fair chance of finding a fix (Seem to be gone in 7.2 though).&nbsp;Try to run Skype as administrator (no you're not administrator), shift+rightclick the Skype shortcut, choose run as administrator, this has been a working workaround for the call buttons not responding.&nbsp;Have you tried using shortcut keys, for answering?"
SkypeCommunityHistory,28173,Why doesn't Skype not close when you click the X b...,"What he was talking about was setting it to """"run as administrator"" in the shortcut/executable as you should know that would run the application in a true administrator mode (like Windows XP) vs. the default crippled administrators group in Windows. &nbsp;I personally have not had to do this since I have not run into the issue but for those that have, people claimed it has helped/resolved the issue. &nbsp;In regards to following UI interaction rules, it does as it actually closes the form. &nbsp; &nbsp;Skype doesn't send an additional closure to the resident system tray icon form because it's a memory resident communication program. &nbsp;Some programs give you that option, others don't. &nbsp;&nbsp;Geforce Experience is one of the latest programs I use, that doesn't. &nbsp;Nobody forces anything on you. &nbsp;If you feel your family is ""forcing"" something on you, you always have the option of ""forcing"" something on them or suggesting another method you prefer &nbsp;in order to stay in contact with you. &nbsp;In the end that's a family issue, not a Skype one.&nbsp;If you want to close Skype down in one click you can do so using the provided shortcuts in the following thread. &nbsp;You can also assign those shortcuts hotkeys or assign them to a key on your keypboard/mouse using additional key mapping software to completely&nbsp;close Skype with the press of a single button.&nbsp;http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-clie?nt/How-to-quit-Skype-with-keyboard-shortcut-on-Win?...&nbsp;"

SkypeCommunityHistory,28210,Unchangeable keyboard shortcut in skype interferin...,"I use multiple monitors, and need to use another program to make good use of them. I use a simple freeware program to lock the cursor to the screen unoless a button is pressed, and it only offers&nbsp;one shortcut (ctrl+`) for jumping between screens. This program is always running, so if I jump from one screen to the next and immediately go to type in skype, it types an accented letter like&nbsp;à or&nbsp;è since it shares this shortcut with Skype. The problem is that it simply won't type any other non-accented version letters on the first press, so I just end up skipping the first letter completely most of the time. There seems to be no way to change this shortcut on skype under the options, so I'm wondering if there is another way to get around this (outside of switching mouse control programs, which I've tried but have had little luck with finding something as good).

She did not shared the link of my video with me though. immediatly closed the skype. I swear sleeping at night was the hardest of all.Today, after reading all these, my fear is slightly abated.we all share a same story and perhaps a similar situation. I checked my skype account and there was literally no message!! I blocked her.I have no intention of having a saucy stuff infront of cam yesterday. She led the convo and she did everything else. I was like a maniorette.Although after reading all these, i am still horrified of being exposed or of my video used for illigeal stuff as this.Also, i suspect that the video of her was pre-recorded. She said her mic was damaged.I have made my mind that i would not go online in fb for a month or so. I would not open skype too. Though it may be still early to report but i still havent heard of my video being leaked to my friends or family.All in all, yesterday was the most painful and embarrasing day of my life. I just wanted to ask here that is there anyone here whose video was shared to his/her friends? Any type of help is highly appreciated. A lesson well learned. Never going repeat it again. NO WAY!!"

SkypeCommunityHistory,29398,Keep getting stranger asking me to acept them on m...,"Many of these contact requests appear to be phishing attempts by people, others could be bots. It would help to understand more specifically what their motives are. I suspect financial scams because they target mostly adults. These strangers seem to copy and paste from a script because one can have a text dialogue with them WITHOUT accepting the contact request.&nbsp;I usually write something like ""Have we met?"" or ""Where are you from?"" but do NOT click Accept. Some phishers clumsily attempt to steer back to their script but clearly they are not who they claim to be. If I'm not busy I try to waste as much of their time as possible because that will spare someone else this annoyance. Phishers can see that I am a male so they usually pretend to be a young woman, show a bikini picture on a beach and offer links to porn videos. They want my credit card number ""to validate my age"". I never click the links because those pages are probably full of malware.&nbsp;Skype's makers score badly by failing to deal with this problem. They could easily block overly broad searches, use email or SMS to validate genuine contact requests or enable incoming requests only during a user selected time window in the manner of Bluetooth pairing. Evidently ""fun"", ""easy"" and ""expansion"" are higher priorities than ""responsible"" in the minds of the designers, same as in those awful web megaphones such as Facebook.&nbsp;While I'm in complaining mode, it's inconvenient to have to make up yet another pseudononymous identity, complete with email address, in order to participate in this forum. Skype should provide the anonymous protection, the way eBay automatically shields the identities of bidders in auctions, or something like that. Come on Skype, it cannot be that hard for you to do!"

If you call a bank a raise a security issue they&nbsp;cancel your card.&nbsp; Why won't SKYPE freeze my account until this has been resolved?

I cannot successfully fill in all the answers to the form and that is it, no other option.&nbsp; Skype (ironically) cannot call me to discuss the issue! There is no on-line chat facility.&nbsp; The only help I have is the&nbsp;constant loop of fill in the impossible form!! I was originally told to fill the in the form as many times as I needed to, until I get the answers right.&nbsp; I have since been told that if I make more than 2 incorrect submissions my account is&nbsp;irrevocably&nbsp;irretrievable.2- The second advise is to open a new account and forget about the other account!&nbsp; But this is FRAUD!

I then uninstalled skype (main program and the click to call add during the install) and the the icons returned to normal operation. Downloaded the latest from the skype website and reinstalled. This time no click to call. Icons image and functionality became inactive again. Uninstalled one more time and this time the pinned icons that were showing as disconnected were removed from the taksbar by the skype uninstall.&nbsp;Accessories versions of them were functioning normally and required a manual repinning to the taskbar. So ... the new install has issues. On both installs, I unchecked the two selections for Bing as my home page and Bing Desktop&nbsp;install. Could be skpye/MS getting mad that I did not take their tech for granted, but I just don't like Bing. That may be part of my issue. Curious to hear if aynone has similar issues. Make sure you check you Accessories folder in the Start Programs.

SkypeCommunityHistory,41116,Auto Update to Ver: 7.2.0.103 refuses to Auto Star...,"Hi Ruwin - OK, I have tried as you suggested to uninstall Kaspersky, then Uninstall and try to Reinstall Skype and the bad news is that it didn't work. However, I now have both good and bad news since that time, being. I once again uninstalled Skype Ver 7.2.0.103 (just to be clear about that). Rebooted and first of all checked MS Updates which informed me that I had 1 optional update being to Install a new Skype Version this being Ver 7.0.0.102, which I accepted and Installed and the Good news is that it works! All seems to be working including the Skype Auto-start at machine startup. However, then the Bad News. After allowing things to settle for a day or two I checked for Skype Updates and it offered me a newer version which I accepted and proceeded to install. Then guess what it returned me right back to where I started with the latest Version (I think) 7.2.0.103 but with no auto- start at boot-up and a manual start with UAC permission required. So I performed the earlier action to uninstall and accept MS Updates Ver 7.0.0.102 and I am now back to working again but still with the older version. So I guess I just wait for another later update and go through the process again when that time comes to see what happens! Not Happy! Something is amiss with the last release..."

SkypeCommunityHistory,41231,"Microsoft have Ïmproved"" my experience again. I am...","Hi all. Two hours ago I needed to make a ten minute phone call within the UK using&nbsp;Skype. This call was to an existing contact's telehone number who I have phoned several hundred times over the years. A business phone and not a mobile. From the UK to the UK.&nbsp;How difficult can that be?&nbsp;Well, I fired up Skype. Up popped a banner screen telling me that Skype (Microsoft) are improving my experience.&nbsp; Yet again. &nbsp;No question about now or later, it was already in progress. They do this virtually evely time I sign on. Which used to be daily, but now I tend to use Fring in order to preserve my sanity.&nbsp;Ok, so off we went. Through the install sequence. &nbsp;My call looked to be a long way in the future. How right I was.&nbsp;I decided not to install Bing on the basis that ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not American and so its results are of little interest to me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I prefer Google&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I detest being pestered by install routines&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am intelligent enough to install it myself if I want it.&nbsp;I also decided not to install MSN as my home page on the basis that ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not American and so its results are of little interest to me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I prefer&nbsp;to choose my own home page.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I detest being pestered by install routines.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am intelligent enough to set it as home&nbsp;myself if I want to.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am over 18 years old so I can think for myself and I have Zero interest in American Football and life in the USA in general, seeing as how I live in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;.... so on we went. It eventually finished and next up popped a screen asking me (as it does with every Ïmprovement"") whether I wanted to sign in with my Skype account or my Microsoft one. Funnily enough they do not store my Skype decision and continue to ask the question every time. I cannot imagine why.&nbsp;So I took the Skype choice and then entered my Skype ID and my correct password. Then waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Fifteen minutes passed.&nbsp;Eventually my old pal Task Manager had to be called up and &nbsp;within a mere five minutes had managed to do what I could not and get rid of Skype. Not completely of course, it needs a nuclear scientist to do that.&nbsp;I really wanted to make my call so I started Skype again and logged in . IT WORKED. I made my call which was robotic and constantly interrupted. &nbsp;Since my Broadband speed is ony 38Mbps I can see how this would cause a problem for Skype, so my problem cannot possible be Microsoft's fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;My call recipient asked me why he was seeing a German number as my Caller ID. This was genuinely my error because I needed to change to my new UK mobile so off I went to change it.&nbsp;Four times I entered my new phone number. Four times I received the SMS with the validation ID on the correct phone. Four times I entered the new confirmation ID - correctly. Four times it was rejected.&nbsp;On the fifth attempt I was refuses the ability to verify my number. Obviously MY fault. It could not possibly be Microsoft&nbsp;My serious question is ... How many more of these ""improvements to our experience"" must there be be fore we can make simple Skype to phone and Skype to Skype calls without all of this rubbish? And when willl the web site work properly?&nbsp;&nbsp;"

I write to contact you over a very important business transaction which will be of our interest and benefit to our both families.In 2007,one (REMOVED), whose surname is same as yours and has your country in his file as his place of origin, made a fixed deposit for 36 months, valued at $26,700,000.00 with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of Managing Director. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 27th of September 2010.Sadly (REMOVED), was among the death victims in the September 2009 earthquake in Indonesia that left over 1,200 people dead while he was there on business trip.Since the last quarter of 2010 until today, the management of my bank has been finding means to reach him so as ascertain if he will roll over the Deposit or have the contract sum withdrawn. When I discovered that this will happen, I have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceeds for business.Some directors here have been trying to find out from me the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed because, I know that if they become aware that Mr. Husson is late, they will corner the funds for themselves. Therefore, am seeking your co-operation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death since you have the same last name with him, My bank head quarters will release the account to you. I have done enough inside bank arrangement and you only have to put in your details into the information network in the bank computers and reflect you as his next of kin.If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 50% of the funds while 50% shall be for me.

Google used to send the verification codes in voice mail OR sms. Now Google seems to have switched off the voice mail. They are sending verification in sms only. Now, because the phone number I put in for verification is a Skype number, and because Skype cannot receive sms, the verification process failed. I tried to set my Skype to forward sms messages to a mobile phone.&nbsp;Interestingly, I received Skype's own verficiation sms sent to mobile phone, but I CANNOT receive Google's verification sms sent to the same Skype number (which skype should theoretically forward to mobile). But I waited and waited and nothing came through. I suspect Skype is deliberately blocking sms messages from Google. Please tell me you are not doing that and it's just a technical problem.

Figuring that I got hacked, I went back to the email I got, which adviced me to fill in the Account Verification Form in order to report security issues with my account -- I filled all the information in, and then I waited for a response.&nbsp;But during the day, chat windows started to pop up -- 'I' was talking to my contacts from another device!!

SkypeCommunityHistory,41861,I used up all minutes with a monthly subscription ...,"My question is if there is a way to continue calling WITHOUT using skype credit after using up all minutes of subscriptions. Is there any?&nbsp;Here's my situation:I purchased a monthly subscription and the service started 3/11/15. I used up all the 400 minutes on 4/2/15. With an intension of starting a&nbsp;NEW subscription that would start 4/2, I first cancelled the existing subscription (that started on 3/11/15 and&nbsp;was scheduled to renew on 4/11/15) and received an email confirmation for that. Then, I got a new subscription (for the same country and for the same duration which is one month as the initial one) and confirmed that it was charged on my paypal account. I also received an email notification for the subscription delivery. It said the transaction date was 4/3/15.&nbsp;So I thought I could start calling on 4/3.&nbsp;Today is 4/3 and I still can't call.&nbsp;I checked my account, and to my surprise,&nbsp;it has been updated to show that&nbsp;my&nbsp;initial subscription is back!? That is the one that starts on the 11th of the month, and the current remaining minutes shows as 0 (zero.) It tells me that I&nbsp;will be able to start calling on&nbsp;4/11. It appears that my attempt to cancel one subscription and get a new one (with a new start date) did not work since the initial one appears to keep coming back.&nbsp;Isn't it possible to cancel an existing subscription completely and sign up a new one with a new start date?&nbsp; I'm trying not to purchase skype credit together with subscriptions.&nbsp;Thanks                                                                                                                  Solved!

Is there really enough of a difference? And is it obvious to everyone else?]"

SkypeCommunityHistory,43323,Hacked and hacked off - why is there no assistance...,"There is a sociological/philosophical issue here. As, when virtual monopoly corps reach a scale where they near ubiquitousness; being cut off by them due to their own issues, can be a serious detriment to one's life through no fault of one's own. In many parts of the world, access to the web is a human right. Cutting innocent people off permanently due to a combination of policy error and 3rd party criminal activity does seem outrageous. At what point will it be a human right that corporations of a certain scale, are required to make an attempt to redress genuine issues such as that raised in this thread? Also, an inability to 'clear one's name' implicitly denies any measure of justice. Likewise, surely a lingering 'association' with criminal activity (conducted on one's account), could not just cause a user potentially serious problems, but could make security services (inc Skype's own) job much harder by creating a far bigger pool of (often innocent) 'suspects' in which criminals can better hide. Much harder to find the needle in a needlessly inflated haystack. Then there is the issue of undoing the damage. If criminals make money by jacking accounts, if you cannot access those accounts to rectify any issue, surely the criminals keep can keep more of the money made (or saved by using our accounts to comminicate/conduct scams at almost no cost to them). That in itself, if something could be done but is not, could be considered close to assisting crims at the expense of customers, sec servs, and indeed Skype itself when good customers are injured by situations like this and forced against their will to other services - if consumers are fortunate enough to have an alternative service available at all. Otherwise, they are just left disadvantaged. To end on a constructive point. Skype, please help us out here. And lose the question about date account opened. Almost no-one after a decade will be able to anwer that, even to the right year without just guessing. And a year would be so vague as to be useless as a sec Q anyway. Seems that hackers would be more likely to be able to correctly answer that Q than a long-term customer."

In other words it keeps ringing after the elapsed configured time (default of 15 secs) and no voice mail message is presented to the caller.&nbsp;Details&nbsp;When a call is placed from a landline (meaning not a skype-to-skype call)&nbsp;to a my Skype phone number, Windows Phone correctly indicates an incoming Skype call. However if the call is unanswered then it simply keeps ringing and no voice mail message is presented. If 'IGNORE' is tapped on the phone, then a busy signal is presented to the caller and so obviously no voice mail message in this case either.&nbsp;If I turn off the phone or uninstall Skype from the phone, then voice messaging functions as expected.&nbsp;As of 10 Apr 2015 I'm running the most recent app version on Windows Phone 8.1 (there doesn't appear to be a way to display the actual Skype app version&nbsp;number).&nbsp;&nbsp;Skype is configured as follows:To 'Receive unanswered calls' after 15 secsTo&nbsp;'Start recording a voice message'&nbsp; if 'I am already in a call'To&nbsp;'Start recording a voice message'&nbsp; if 'I reject a call'Call forwarding is not enabled&nbsp;So has anyone else experienced this?

Interestingly, I have another laptop, almost exactly the same, and the other laptop received and send high quality video and internet connection is shown as fast. Here is what I tried:&nbsp;1. Forwarded relevant ports. Tried different ports.2. Enabled/disabled uPNP in advanced connection settings of the Skype.3. Used Skype via wired internet connection. First through router, then directly from cable modem. Internet Speed via speedtest.net for both wireless and wired connections is at least 30Mbps download and 3Mbps Upload4. Connected the laptop to LTE mobile internet and made the call, same result.5. Uninstalled/reinstalled Skype. Tried latest or older versions. Cleaned up all registry settings. Now installed the latest version again.6. Made a video call using Google Hangouts - quality was great.7. Reset IE settings (as per official Skype advice)8. Obviously, restarted Win 7 (64bit) few times&nbsp;None of the above fixed the issue. Below is the copy from call statistics.

It is a subject to change if it is determined that UVC behaves better than HMFT (considering not only load and battery drain, but also quality and stability).UVC 1.5 hardware encoding will only be seen on Surface Pro 3 internal cameras, not C930e. You should not be seeing UVC1.5 on C930e, because it was disabled due to instability. UVC 1.5 will take preference over HMFT in case of Surface Pro 3 internal cameras. In any case, this is not related to current topic.&nbsp;As for CPU load - this is complicated topic. It is true that HMFT will consume some CPU (more than UVC), but the gain is not really spectacular in practice. Please consider not only the CPU percentage, but also frequency. The OS often throttles the frequency to conserve power, and the loads should not be compared on different frequencies. CPU load is also influenced by other things (background processes, incoming video, audio, etc, etc)&nbsp;Also, when talking about logs, I meant Skype logs, created as described there: https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12321/how-do-i-?create-log-files?If you provide a log with erroneous behavior, we'll be able to take a look.

The only thing I found a little confusing was adding friends *apparently you need to relaunch it at least once after installing it*&nbsp;Currently This looks Like a perfect Alternative to Skype. Im going to convince my 200 friends on skype to switch over to it. My Suggestion would be use Skype when you want to do large video calls. Or screensharing. And use Tox for everything that its currently capable of doing. *You can get a program like Sparkocam to do screensharing Which is what im going to be doing*I will Forever Ditch Skype. I invite Everyone to join me, in Saying NO to microsoft that we wont take this load of BS they trying to shove up where the sun dont shine. &nbsp;Maybe they will Fix this thing called skype. This is what Microsoft seems very good at doing. They make crap, Expect everyone to use it.

I just mjade a test call and it workis! I still have no idea why this default changed itself but it's probably one of the wonders of Windows. In any case, thanks a lot for the help!"

But I don't really see that something is wrong at the moment.Hi Dimmoff,&nbsp;Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;I have previously provided some logs to the Skype Tier-2 Team (specifically, to Emil L.) - the process wasn't exactly the same as described in that link, but similar, so I am hoping that is what you need.&nbsp;By the way, I'm not quite clear whether you are one of the Skype developers - Emil L. mentioned&nbsp;(after my previous post) that ""our developers have expressed desire to reach you personally through the forum thread you have mentioned, so kindly wait for them to address your concern on the forum/community.""&nbsp;If the&nbsp;logs I provided aren't sufficient (they were 875MB... ) then please let me know what else you need.&nbsp;With that said...&nbsp;The email I got from Emil L. in response to the logs I sent over explained that:&nbsp;There is truly an error in call technical info, coming from VideoCapturer.cpp:   videoInfo.fourcc == FOURCC_H264     This is not correct, is actionable and should be fixed.So I am assuming that something is not right with the desktop version currently (but do not know what to make of the error message Emil L. is referring to).&nbsp;If I've understood your previous message, you seem to be saying:Where&nbsp;the Surface Pro 3's internal cameras are used - UVC 1.5 should be shown, not HMFT.Where&nbsp;the c930e is used - UVC 1.5 has been disabled due to instability, so HMFT will be used instead.Does the latter point&nbsp;basically mean that the c930e's hardware encoding is currently not being made use of at all?&nbsp;As to why this matters - the real issue is that the Surface Pro 3's fan is barely noticeable where the modern app version of Skype is used, but unbearably loud when the desktop version of Skype is used.&nbsp;Here are some observations from testing with a Logitech c920 just now. I had to use a c920 as I don't have my c930e to hand today - but I think the issue is common to both webcams.&nbsp;The tests were&nbsp;performed using (1) a Surface Pro 3 with a c920 calling (2) a MacBook Air. The laptops are on the same network so bandwidth and latency is not an issue. Neither laptop was running any other CPU-intensive applications.1. If the SP3 uses the modern app version of Skype then:The MacBook Air receives 1920x1080 at 15 fps.The MacBook Air's Call Technical Info shows codec H264 (CHP/40).The SP3's clockspeed remains approx. 0.7GHz-0.9GHz and Task Manager shows Skype using 6-7% CPU.The SP3's fan does not kick in. The SP3's back remains cool to the touch.2. By contrast, if the Surface Pro 3 uses the desktop version of Skype then:The MacBook Air continues to receive 1920x1080 at 15fps.The MacBook Air's Call Technical Info continues to show&nbsp;codec H264 (CHP/40).The SP3's clockspeed increases to approx. 1.2GHz-1.6GHz and Task Manager shows Skype using a higher percentage CPU.The SP3's fan kicks in. The SP3's back becomes uncomfortably hot.Note: I am not clear why only 15fps was being sent. Sometimes the c920 and c930e get to 15fps - sometimes they don't. As noted above, bandwidth and latency were not an issue in my tests.&nbsp;So in summary, the modern app version seems to be far more efficient than the desktop version.&nbsp;I am speculating that this is because&nbsp;the c920's / c930e's hardware encoding is not being currently used by the desktop version (but is being used by the modern app version).&nbsp;I should say that I would love to use the modern app version all the time - but unfortuately I&nbsp;can't (it's much easier to multi-task with the desktop version).&nbsp;I hope this (rather long post) is helpful in identifying and resolving the issue...&nbsp;"
SkypeCommunityHistory,48272,Logitech c930e - hardware encoding (still) not sup...,"Hi GunboatDiplomat,&nbsp;Thanks for the info. I have seen the logs you provided, and it seems these are from modern client only.&nbsp;So I am assuming that something is not right with the desktop version currently (but do not know what to make of the error message Emil L. is referring to).Yes, that's actually my comment  The issue I mentioned is just about statistics reporting: ""HwEnc: 0"" when it should be ""HwEnc: 1"". This is just stats, however: in reality, HW encoding may be used.&nbsp;If I've understood your previous message, you seem to be saying:Where&nbsp;the Surface Pro 3's internal cameras are used - UVC 1.5 should be shown, not HMFT.Where&nbsp;the c930e is used - UVC 1.5 has been disabled due to instability, so HMFT will be used instead.&nbsp;Yep, that's the situation. UVC will not be used as long as HMFT is present (Surface Pro 3 internal cameras are exceptions!). It should also be true for WinModern. In the logs you provided, HMFT was used as well, which is expected.&nbsp;As for performance issues you are describing - this is truly worrying. Some quick tests on Surface Pro 3 really do show a difference (even though it's the same camera, same HW and same GPU driver). We'll have to investigate it further.&nbsp;By the way, 15FPS is probably happening because of poor lighting conditions. It's camera's internal behavior to reduce FPS if it is too dark. Try switching on brigher lights and see if you get 30FPS."

Now when she tries to use her large fonts because of the lay out with the new software and the video chat placement with the chat on the side she can't see any thing any more, just lines of color but no text. With the old way with the video at the top and the text on the bottom she could read at least one sentence at a time but now it's useless.&nbsp;There has to be a way to fix this but at this time I'm getting the feeling that ""It's been designed this way"" and our only recourse is to ""Like it the way it is"" or find a competitors program that still offers customization of the lay out on the screen. As it stands now If she wants to use the current version of Skype her only recourse is to enable accessibility options and have her chat read to her as if she was totally blind.&nbsp;Wile this is helpful for those people who need that kind of help my wife was able to use the program with out audio only a month ago and now it has been ""Improved"" but the improvement has not been seen as such by my wife and I. Plus having your computer read things to you wile your in a video chat is not very helpful.&nbsp;She needs to be able to see links and other things that are being sent to her that she needs to be able to click on. Right now they're hidden by the UI changes. If something can actually be done to help in this matter that would be great but I'm worried this message may fall on deaf ears.&nbsp;The message groups are full of people who are utterly furious about the UI changes but nothing substantial seams to happen. The overall lay out and function of older versions compared to now is night and day. References to giving your chat ""room to breath"" have been made. Seriously?&nbsp;These are all ""Visual Preferences"" that should be adjustable by the users. People with vision impairments need the tools to be able to actually control lay out on their system.&nbsp;Are there any ""Real"" plans to put in place some working visual tools to allow for classic view or giving the users control over layout of the Skype UI?

SkypeCommunityHistory,49233,Skype Status Keeps Changing From Invisible Back To...,"Dear All,&nbsp;From reading this (and similar) thread[s], it appears that:&nbsp;The issue has been around for quite a while (several years, I should say), andThat there isn't a single solution that may satisfy all.With this in mind however, I should like to share my own experience and the way by which -- eventually -- things seem to have fallen nicely in place. Hopefully, some of you may be able to use the same steps I did to stop Skype from auto-reverting to Online status when all you want is to remain Invisible ...&nbsp;Some of you mentioned that the issue seems to be somehow related to the mobile app.&nbsp;You appear to be correct; the trouble however is to discover ALL of the mobile apps you have installed and that are sharing the same Skype Name.&nbsp;In my case, besides using Skype on a couple of PCs, as well as an Android smartphone, I overlooked the fact that I also had Skype installed (same Skype Name ...) on a ""PC on a dongle"" (you know, that little device that looks like a disk-on-key and connects via HDMI to a regular TV set to practically turn it into an Android PC).That dongle, while not permanently on the TV display, it was permanently turned on, and -- along with it -- the Skype app running in the background (you get the picture ...)&nbsp;From the moment I turned this latter Skype instance to ""Invisible"" (as well as the instance running on my Android smartphone, of course), the PC instances stopped from auto-reverting to Online (just in case anybody wonders how to manage this on an Android device: on the top-right side of the screen is displayed the default avatar for your own persona; click on it, and from the resulting sub-menu select Invisible).&nbsp;A couple of lessons to be learned from the above:&nbsp;Regretfully, it looks as if Microsoft has not implemented on Android the same policy it had for Windows, namely the one that forced all Skype instances to accept the same Status as the one most recently implemented on any of the running instances (and to log-on in a new instance, while preserving the most recent running status).In view of the above, if you don't want to be auto-reverted to the Online status, just make sure that ALL mobile devices are set to Invisible (and do so within a SHORT interval of time, to prevent one device anihilating your steps from the previous one ...)&nbsp;Of course, point 2. is just a workaround; the solution should come from Skype / Microsoft, by implementing the old good policy from Windows in the mobile devices too.&nbsp;Hope this helps.&nbsp;Good luck,&nbsp;Eric&nbsp;P.S.: As an afterthought: if anyone wishes to get a reply from Skype Support (see &lt; https://support.skype.com/support_selection &gt;), I believe they may be contacted directly and not only through the Community Forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
SkypeCommunityHistory,49251,People from skype sending friends request on faceb...,"Hello,&nbsp;I received 2 friends requests on my facebook profile, coming from 2 different people that I have only as skype contacts. They are not close friends or anything, just two people I met online.My skype profile is not connected with my facebook, nor my skype username looks any similar to my facebook username. Even the email I used to create my facebook account is different from the one I used to create my skype/msn account.I asked them directly how come they added me on facebook, and they just didn't know. They did not even know who I was.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew they were from skype because their name was the same.&nbsp;So I assumed&nbsp;that when these people made their facebook profile, they authorized facebook to look into their skype contact list for people they already knew and &nbsp;send out friends request, so they send their request to me without knowing (you usually just send to everyone in your contact list).&nbsp;My concern is how come that my skype id was ""linked"" to my personal facebook profile, without me even knowing it? I repeat: i do not have the same email, username, and my skype and facebook profile are not linked. Fortunately this happened only twice, and it was one year ago, so I assume facebook has changed the way it scans through skype contacts. Nevertheless it was very disturbing as I kept my skype profile anonymous and all of a sudden I had people looking for my real name on facebook. How could this happen?"
SkypeCommunityHistory,49855,"Skype having hiccup freezes while messaging, but s...","I checked my temp monitor (whcih also tells me my current processor info etc) And I noticed Skype was causing Intel turbo booster to run, which was spiking my CPU usage randomly excessively high in spikes in the task manager as mu CPU was running at 3600-3800 MHz (I have an Intel i5 4670K 3400MHz , turbo booster is a built in fuction that safely overclocks it on auto in small bursts, and within temp limts, to increase preformance.&nbsp; I do not overclock for gaming, this is just a built in feature with the high end Intel CPUs, and would be the only reason to see the high MHz levels occuring ).&nbsp;Tbh the booster should only occur with gaming or what not. Why the hell would skype require so much memory that it activates the booster and keeps it activated? :T&nbsp; Glitchy!!I turned off the Intel Turbo boost as a test, and now my CPU is 3400MHz across the board.&nbsp; (my core temps are the same tho, as the spiking before was not increasing temps or anything, as I said, it is meant to do it within safe limits).SO FAR no more WHEA-Logger Event 19 errors or memory spikes.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"
SkypeCommunityHistory,49871,Messages not saving into history after quitting Sk...,"&nbsp;A few months ago, I didn't quit Skype for a week so when I did there were a lot of messages to save. However, my whole laptop was lagging really bad (not because of Skype) and I ended up having to force shut down my laptop.&nbsp;When I went back on, all of the messages&nbsp;that were created during the week were gone, though after a while, all of the one-on-one messages I re-received but the&nbsp;ones in the group conversations&nbsp;never came back.Ever since then, when I quit Skype and log back on, occasionally the messages created since the last time I quit wouldn't save. I'd eventually get the one-on-one messages back by quitting and reopening Skype again repeatedly, and&nbsp;I'd delete everything Skype related except for my main.db and reinstall Skype&nbsp;to&nbsp;get the group conversation messages. This occurs&nbsp;often and it gets annoying doing this same process over again whenever this happens.&nbsp;Is there something wrong with my main.db, since deleting everything else doesn't seem to work? Is there a way to solve this problem?(I have Mac 10.7.5 (lion) and Skype 6.15, and the ""Save chat history"" option is set to ""Forever."")"

Data is data, and a link is a link. Data should be displayed, and links should remain links. If someone wants me to see a web page, they should make a screen grab to their local computer, and then send me the picture as an image. Otherwise they should send me a link, which then I can peruse at my own convenience (which usually includes first scrubbing the link of any identifying trailing garbage.)As a matter of fact, I don't want Microsoft/Skype to PARSE ANYTHING that I transmit.Just as automatic loading of remote images in HTML e-mail messages constitutes a major security risk and privacy breach, so does this web preview function.I have absolutely no intention to disclose who I'm conversing with and what we talk about, but if someone sends me a link that hasn't been properly ""cleaned up"", then the site will know who sent me the link, who received it, what the conversation might have been about etc. and that information is sent without my consent.I have ZERO tolerance for Microsoft's lack of sensitivity to privacy, and where we users are being stripped naked to prying eyes, all in the guise of some ""neat features"".I don't need no ""neat features"". If you want web links to work the way they are supposed to work on the Mac, then allow for a right-click with a QuickLook option, but display the link in it's full length with all the ""garbage"" that will be transmitted to the site when the link is clicked upon, no ""user friendly URL"" version, that makes a link look like it were a harmless, state-free static link, while in fact it's a 900 character long monster with encoded state and personal details.&nbsp;One might think that's part of the PRISM program..."

Hello and welcome to the Skype Community.  1. Your account shows that you reached&nbsp;your Subscription limit on April 25th 2015.  2. You made one call after your Subscription limit was reached which was paid for by your Skype Credit.  3. Your credit account was charged with €0,37 which included a connection fee of €0,036. Connection fees are only charged if the call is funded by credit.  When you reach your Subscription limit and you don't have any credit you can't make any calls.

(letters numbers)B) Did not link anything to SkypeC)&nbsp;Made my photo&nbsp;a generic one.D) Did not provide any phone numbersThen I logged in (from my computer www.skype.com) and updated the following as such...&nbsp;1. My profile photo originally was shown only to my contacts that I have added to my account.&nbsp;(now I currently&nbsp;use a generic photo)2. I kept my first name but show my last name as a single letter.3. Gender, Left that in, because it is pretty obvious by my first name.4. Birthday, I logged into the skype.com on my computer, hit edit and was able to modify by selecting the day.month.year fields and saved this information.Today mine now just shows up as ""add your birthday"" (COOL!)(Optionally you can use a generic date, say 01/01/1901)I am sure there are already millions of people born on that day. heh??5. Language is completed so I do not have issues with other languages that i do not understand.6. City, Left that blank, no need to narrow down my location.7. State, Added that in, feel comfortable because CA is a pretty big state with a lot of me's in it right??8. Country Good ole' US of A ...&nbsp; Ok there, Patriotism is allowed right?9. About me, left blank. Couldn't think of anything cool to say.&nbsp;Thats about it.Now since I do not use the Skype as a ""FIND MY FRIENDS"" service, the above works for me. I can give anyone whom knows me my skype name (which is cryptic) so they can find me and request to become a contact.If you use Skype as a FIND MY FRIENDS service then it would be best to include some of the data as requested which allows someone that may be looking for you to locate you much easier.&nbsp;Hope this helps and works for you as well.&nbsp;Have a great day,Respectfully,Me"
SkypeCommunityHistory,50785,Skype crashes: please add reliable option to NOT u...,"Thank you ruwim but I can't see anything new in those links. Yes, the Hauppauge driver causes the Skype crash. That doesn't explain why Skype 7.1 and all earlier versions work perfectly fine with that very same driver. The suggestion to remove/disable the driver thus disabling the device is illogical, I'm sure you can see why. This makes more sense: Skype 7.2+ versions cause the crash.&nbsp;Hauppauge adds several drivers to my system, the one causing the crash is the one highlighted: (Hauppauge WinTV 88x Video (Hybrid, DVB-T/S2+IR). They are the ones offerred for my device by Hauppauge here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I properly uninstalled and deleted them and let Windows install their own drivers. It seems it installs the same versions and crash remains. Something I've never seen before: after cleaning the Hauppauge drivers, upon restart (when Windows installs its own) I get an 'unsigned' warning (attached) on a Hauppauge audio driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, is the problem with these old Hauppauge drivers that need to be fixed/signed/updated by Hauppauge (even though they work with Skype 7.1) or is the problem with Skype 7.2 (and newer) and Microsoft doesn't seem to bother fixing because these drivers are old? Please advise, thank you.&nbsp;There are no Hauppauge applications installed here, just the drivers for the PCI device.

Note that skype recognize her email address and even shows her skype id.&nbsp;So I logged into my account and tried to contact support. The chat option didn't work. For the email option, the list of questions I had to answer to send in a support request was unbelievable. Some of the required questions (like 5 contacts on my contct list or when I registered skype) was clearly for proving I was the account holder. But I already signed in. Why put up so many barriers for customers trying to contact support? Finally, after I entered my message, I got a&nbsp;""unavailable, try again later"" message. My request descxribe the issue is lost.&nbsp; I spent over an hour for nothing! Skype used to be so much more customer friendly. It felt like now that it didn't care about its customers. I used to work for Microsoft and continue to wish the company to succeed. But sorry to say, this has been one of the worst if not the worst customer expereinces I've had.&nbsp;So what can we do now to receover my wife's account? She still has credit in her account."

My apologies.What version of Windows are you on?Microsoft Update was the merged version of Windows Update and MS Office Update on Windows XP and Vista. On Windows 7 and 8 it's called Windows Update again (go MS for being persistent).&nbsp;On Windows 7, if you click Start -&gt; All programs, then Windows Update should be in the very top of the list. On Windows 8 I think you have to go through control panel. On XP I can't remember if it's in the first layer or buried in a folder somewhere.&nbsp;Either way I highly recommend switching Windows Update to manual install (but let it tell you when there are updates). MS pushes in a ton of updates as ""important"" that are in no way important, needed, or do anything for the user (like Skype 7 and the MS spyware to report how you use your Windows). And on manual install, Windows won't install updates while you're running heavy programs (like games), and then proceed to break your programs and throw away hours of work by forcefully rebooting the computer while you're in the middle of something. On manual you can let it update only what you want and only when you take a break from the computer anyway. Just make sure to always install the security updates. All the others you can safely ignore if you want (recommended is to review all updates before installing, but when it doubt, just untick the box)."

OUCH!&nbsp;Considering the fact that Skype is now owned by Microsoft, there is absolutely NO WAY I am going to grant unfettered unrestricted access to my computer without my knowledge or prior consent TO ANY VENDOR. Microsoft offers this type of secret update access but also gives the user three choices, including just being informed of availability of updates. So why in the world would I give Skype, now a Microsoft proxy, a permission that exceeds that of Microsoft? It makes no sense at all.&nbsp;Given the lousy security situation on the Internet I find this ""agreement"" to be subject to possible abuse on several levels. So I'm going to stick with my current version (5.5.0.124) until Skype delivers a more sensible approach that addresses my security needs.&nbsp;Incidently, I've been a paid Skype subscriber since 2002.

SkypeCommunityHistory,52036,How to tell if a friend deleted you from his/her c...,"Hi,&nbsp;Sorry for reposting the age-old question, but I was wondering if anyone is aware if Skype policies have changed regarding this old question. According to the older forum posts, about a year or two old, if someone deletes you from Skype, there are differing opinions as to whether or not you can see the contact online or not. (Skype won't let me link the old forum post, so you'll have to Google it)&nbsp;However, the tests I ran using a dud Skype account show that if I delete ""myself,"" the ""resend contact request"" button appears. It seems to clearly show that I deleted a contact. If I block a contact, then the contact only appears offline. The first part seems to contradict what the older forum posts claim, and I was wondering if this Skype behavior has changed. Does it matter if the contacts are connected to the same supernode? I'm also doing this on a PC, so does the behavior change if my contact using the Mac or mobile version?&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, my question is in regards to a specific contact which I have been wondering if that person deleted me from their contact list. What is the privacy setting for mood messages? If I can see the contact's mood message, does that mean they have not deleted me? I know it says ""Contacts only"" for mood message under privacy, but I don't know if that means current contacts, or those who have been ""authorized"" as contacts.&nbsp;Thanks                                                                                                                   Solved!

Basically, i found out recently that someone has been following me on games and some social media (i'm hard to dox luckily so she's not found too much). But after looking into her this week i see she's been stalking me for about two years and the past month her stalking has creeped up i noticed.&nbsp;Anyway, she's doing this for personal reasons, and there is a reason for her to do this i guess - although it doesn't make any sense to me for her to - so i figured i'd go find her and block her before she finds my stuff, seemed like the sensible thing to do and luckily she uses pretty much the same names for everything so it was no problem to do this and i wanted to avoid problems in the first place. I accidently called her on skype when i went to block her, just clicked the wrong thing when looking for the block. Then i found block and blocked her.&nbsp;My question is, will she now know my user name on here and details? I think i'm gonna have to delete my account and make a new one if she does."

I objected that I have already tried to delete the whole %appdata%\Skype folder and it did not help. So, how can deleting one file in %appdata%\Skype folder help? However, it seems to be beyond the manager's understanding.The furth manager suggested that I reinstall Skype again and that I send ""/remotelogout"" command. He assured me that this will surely help, though did not explain how.Now the question: how can I get qualified support?&nbsp;Also:Is it possible that somebody logs into my account from other place and this switches my Skype to offline?Should I see some notification if somebody does this?"

Only the first and third sequences are different.I changed the password 3 times (incl. skype account recovery where you have to put quite specific data, whilst i another tab of the web browser, where I had logged in before, I was still able to manipulate the account). That did not change the list of logged in devices (and I didn't check if I was able to make a call to those two mobile numbers).&nbsp;Then I switched the phone completely off. Checked again with/showplacesand I still can see the above 3 devices, despite there should be only one now. However, I can call those two numbers now.Unfortunately in the end of that play I typed another coman:/remotelogoutwhich kills all other sessions except from this one, from which such comand is executed.So looks like my problem is solved FOR NOW, but I still want to know what the hell happened.Please advise."

No reason to wait if you are going to be online or not.

SkypeCommunityHistory,78782,"called phone doesn't ring when the ""ring ring"" I h...","Sometimes when I call a mobile phone from my Windows/Firefox Skype, the ""ring ring"" I hear as the connection is being made is different, not a ""ring"" but more like a fog horn with an echo. Whenever that happens the called phone doesn't seem to ring and the called phone just sees a missed call, and their phone doesn't seem to actually ring. With the odd rings/horns, the call does not go through to voicemail, the horn just ends. The called phone does have voicemail so if the connection was actually made that should activate when the call isn't answered, but this is not happening when I hear the odd horn instead of ring.&nbsp;Other times, I hear the more old-timey ""ring ring"" and the call does connect. Only when I hear the old ring sound does the call get through.&nbsp;What I do is try calling, again and again. But as long as I'm just getting the horn instead of ring the call never connects. Eventually I hear the familiar old ring, and those calls are either answered or go to voice mail, instead of just the horn ending.&nbsp;What causes this?&nbsp;Thanks in advance for your help!"
SkypeCommunityHistory,78925,Skype number from 4 countries on individual channe...,"Hi, PardesiRadio, and welcome to the Community,  &nbsp;  You can't have it both ways.&nbsp; This is an ""either-or"" situation.  &nbsp;  The only way to have each Skype Number on a separate channel is to create a new account for each Skype Number&nbsp;that you need, so you can answer each inbound call separately.  &nbsp;  If you add all of the Skype Number subscriptions to a single Skype account, the inbound calls could be answered only on that Skype account to which the subscriptions were started.  &nbsp;  PardesiRadio wrote:  &nbsp;Can I forward all the numbers from to my existing&nbsp;ID from other ID that might need to make so all calls can be answered from one device?&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes, you could theoretically answer all of the calls on one account, but this provides no call separation unless you signed on to - what appears to be eight if I counted correctly - separate devices (eight ""instances"" of the same account being logged on somehow).&nbsp; This is getting complicated.&nbsp; If I was a Skype fraud system,&nbsp; I might be alerted if one account was simultaneously signed on that many times.  &nbsp;  PardesiRadio wrote:  Bottom line is that several callers can be on the conference and each one can be on a separate channel to get he best audio quality. All the numbers should be pointing to one ID and all calls should be answered from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;    You can create a conference call easily enough if you set up a single Skype account assigned to a single Skype Number subscription.&nbsp; Would this provide the separation you wish to achieve?&nbsp; The only thing I am fuzzy about myself is how your mixer will interpret a conference call - I think this would combine all of the inbound calls into a single channel.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Bottom line: Definitely test&nbsp;your two scenarios&nbsp;before launching to production.&nbsp; You can purchase the Skype Number subscriptons for a minimum of three months.&nbsp; If what you are trying to achieve does not work no matter which way you configure, simply cancel the Skype Number subscriptions at least four to five days ahead of renewal processing three days prior to the end of the subscripton, so they do not renew.&nbsp; (In other words, Skype subscriptions renew automatically be default three days before the end of the subsription.&nbsp; If you do not need or want to renew the Skype Number(s), be sure to cancel a week before the renewal processes).  &nbsp;  Best regards,  Elaine                              __________________________________________________________________________________________________Was your question answered?

I was his account officer before. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 27th of September 2010. Sadly Mr. Hilson was among the death victims in the September 2009 earthquake in Haiti that left over 1,200 people dead while he was there on business trip.Since the last quarter of 2010 until today, the management of my bank has been finding means to reach him so as ascertain if he will roll over the Deposit or have the contract sum withdrawn. When I discovered that this will happen, I have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceeds for business.Some directors here have been trying to find out from me the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed because, I know that if they become aware that Mr. Hilson Meyer is dead they will corner the funds for themselves.

SkypeCommunityHistory,82737,Audio Problem: Skype audio comes through external ...,"I recently upgraded my computer to Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and Skype to Version 7.8.&nbsp;I used to use Skype with my Logitech H800 headset with no problems. However after the upgrade, the speaker audio is now forced through the external speakers instead of the headset. When I make a call, I hear the connecting sound effects through my headset, but when the call connects, the person's voice is coming through my external speakers.&nbsp;Here is what my settings look like (see below). As you can see, the Skype settings are configured correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also tested my OS X Sound settings in the System Preferences. They are set to ""Line Out"" by default because I want to hear my music through my speakers, but want to take phone calls on my headset. Changing the system settings to the Logitech Wireless Headset is a temporary fix, however it is an extra manual step that has to be repeated with each phone call and when the call ends, I have to switch it back to Line Out.&nbsp;This used to be automatic feature, switching to the headset for an incoming or outgoing call.&nbsp;Any suggestions on how to fix this issue and get Skype to automatically put calls through my headset? I worked with a Skype technician and she couldn't figure out why it was happening.&nbsp;Thanks in advance for your input.

SkypeCommunityHistory,711,So you want to change your primary mail but can't ...,"Hi!I ran into the same problem as a lot of other people seem to have done.&nbsp;I am changing ISP and because of that I have to change my mail address from my 10 year old [e-mail removed for privacy and security] to something else, this time I choose to use an outlook.com address in the hope that I will be able to keep that a bit longer.&nbsp;last week I realized that my skype account had my old expiring address as the primary mail, and that the primary mail was the only mail that skype will use for communication with me - I already had 2 other mail addresses in my skype profile (outlook.com and gmail). The skype account was created last summer using my microsoft account, and the microsoft account is the only means I have for accessing the skype account. So I logged on and opended the profile page, went on to edit the info and marked my outlook mail as the primary, clicked save and got the password question. I entered the password I use for logging on (ie the microsoft account password), but was told that the password was wrong. I tried everything and some more things, I spent 40-50 minutes on a text chat with skype support, only to be told that it can't be done and that the skype account was hard tied to the mail address I had used when creating the account, which I found very strange as I had used my microsoft account. yes, when I created the skype account, the only mail I had connected to the microsoft account was my ""[e-mail removed for privacy and security]"" mail, but I have since then, without any problems, been able to create an outlook.com address, and have that added, added a gmail account, set the outlook.com as the primary for the microsoft account and remove the ""[e-mail removed for privacy and security]"" address from the microsoft account. no problem.The problem is actually worse as the mail account will be free for use after april 1, which means that a person claiming that mail address will risk getting extremely confusing mails regarding a skype account they don't have, they will have difficulties creating a skype account of their own, AND they can take over my skype account (as they are the owners of the mail address) and I won't be able to stop them.&nbsp;How is that for security   &nbsp;Fortunately I spent 2 more hours and stumbled on the solution &nbsp;This is where a normal scam artist would ask you to click on a link to a web apge that would releive you of all your money, but I won't do that.&nbsp;so, what is going on when you want to change the primary email, why isn't your password accepted???&nbsp;It turns out that when you create a skype account using your microsoft account (and I guess&nbsp; your facebook account), skype will actually create a ""proper"" skype user account as well, but they hide it from you, and&nbsp;you won't get a password set for it. It is the password for this ""hidden"" account you have to enter when you want to change the primary password  It turns out that I was also unable to connect my facebook account to my skype account for the very same reason, but here it was more obvious, as I had to enter my skype username and passwor when connecting the accounts, and the microsoft account wasn't accepted there .&nbsp;so what do you need to do? well - those of you who have a smart tv (or some other device) that can't log on to skype using a microsoft account, have already done the work (provided you use that tv/device with skype) you log on to skype and&nbsp;open the account settings page, on the line below ""microsoft account&nbsp;&nbsp; your@mail.address&nbsp; unlink&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change microsoft password"" you'll see a line saying ""TV or Device"" or something similar (I have no idea what the english text is) here you have a link you can click on where you will be prompted to enter the password for your ""live:username"" account. once you have&nbsp; done that you get instructions saying that for smart TVs etc, you enter ""live:username"" as the skye user and the newly created password as your password.The good news is that you now have 1) the identity of your skype user (""live:"" and your name where the user name is the combined string ""live:username"" which in my case was ""live:myname""); and 2) a password that is valid for your skype account. what&nbsp;I&nbsp;did next&nbsp;was open up the profile page, edit the profile, mark the outlook.com mail address asthe primary, click save and when prompted for the password, I entered the password I set in the previous step, and that's it, I now had a new primary mail (I got the confirmation mai sent to the new mail address right after I updated the info in skype). I also successfully removed my soon defunct mail address from the mail address list in my skype account, and I then connected my facebook account to my skype account (using live:myname ase the username and my shiny new password).&nbsp;So at the moment I have three different methods available to me when logging in to skype:- my microsoft account- my skype user (live:myname)- my facebook account.the ONLY thing to be aware of is that the name of the microsoft account, as presented on the account settings page in skype, still is my old [e-mail removed for privacy and security] mail address NOTE that this is a presentation issue only, someone thought that it was a good idea to save the original name of the microsoft account in the skype database and use that for presentation. It is NOT used when logging on, when you log on it will use the UID of you rmicrosoft account. if it disturbs you, you can always disconnect you rmicrosoft account from your skype account and reconnect it, and you should see the current mail address associated with the microsoft account. (this is safe to do because you have at least one other method to log on )&nbsp;I hope that skype will amend their FAQ with this info. I did enter into a second chat with skype support, explaining what I díd to resolve the problem they failed to solve. so there it at least 2 people at skype support who know how to resolve the problem.&nbsp;-cheers,Anders&nbsp;"

Just imagine if this happened to someone with little computer know how!. i get the same response email over and over (to the form submissions not my emails) from different service agents telling me to redo it. nowhere in my account does it record my enrollment date, country of enrollment etc. i have to guess at some of these and others having made my acount in 2005: my CC# and purchases i know well but these seem to be insufficient. i am now going to press a claim with paypal against&nbsp; my most recent skype purchase and move on to greener pastures.&nbsp;i had trouble with ebay a few years ago but to redo the same form 8+ times and not have redress to speak to a human being to resolve the matter and to be told again and again to refill the same form to no avail is beyond the pale and simply the worst experience i have ever had with a ""PAID"" internet service.&nbsp; Truly amazing..."

I noticed that I had gotten two emails the day after and immidiately contacted the support.I provided all the information I could, but for the love of god I cannot remember 100% of it.

SkypeCommunityHistory,1563,My internet only works when I am in an active Skyp...,"Skype isn't out to destroy your Internet connection. &nbsp;If your Internet is failing while Skype is in use it's generally going to be due to an issue with your router or if going wireless, wireless device or wireless router. &nbsp;It is rather odd that Internet wouldn't work unless your Skype is actively on a call but that might point to an intermittent connection (like wireless) that only works better with a constant&nbsp;data load. &nbsp;Usually it's the other way around.&nbsp;I highly suggest connecting wired to your router to see if the problem persists. &nbsp;If you can bypass your router and go directly connected then you should try that as well. &nbsp;If your router has any firmware updates, apply those as well. &nbsp;You can also try disabling uPnP in your router and in Skype to see if that resolves &nbsp;your issue. &nbsp;I have had problematic issues in the past that were solely router specific or router firmware specific. &nbsp;I have also had internal and USB wireless devices that did not function properly&nbsp;and required either a different set of drivers, a different placement in my system, or a replacement of the failing hardware (router or client device)."

I received a screenshot of the video being played via Media Player on her/HIS computer. and been asked for 300€. I told to wait as it was 5 am and i couldn't get the money, i've been asked fo mobile number but refused to give it. then i came here and on scamsurvivors and after getting informed on what to do I blocked and reported the skype account, changed all passwords and deactivated the FB account. The name was Emilie Curtis and the skype account emiliecurtis. I think it was from morocco because the names of my friends i was sent had ""ajouter"" which means ""add"" in french beside them, and as you know a lot of people in morocco speak french. I have to say being without facebook is a bit hard for me as i also use it for study reasons and for organizing events. How long do you think i have to wait before reactivating it? of course with new username, display name, email details and profile pictures. Thank you...

SkypeCommunityHistory,6443,A John Smith who i am sure took videos of me on Sk...,"This is to inform you that a person i conversed with initially on Yahoo Messenger, a John Smith or John Cyrus Smith Skype video chatted with me. He said he was from the UK, aged 38 years old and had a sick father, a mother with bone problems and a sister who lived in the States. He himself was undergoinging tests for Leukemia (after one and a half months after talking with me). He worked in an Ad Company and hence most of the time we used to converse late at night. But the thing is i could never see him (he said the Company had a firewall and hence couldnt hear my voice or i who couldnt see him). He i am sure took Videos of me (not being nude, since i never was) but of me wearing a light night wear and oneday only a tee (without jeans) and me performing the seduction kisses (but no more than that). He wanted me to touch somewhere else but i refused to do so. He used the photos of Kevin Kiger (an American Yoga teacher). I did tell him a lot about my family but withheld a lot of real informations too. The said person is said to be 5 foot 9 inches with black eyes. I am glad everyone of my friends and family members know about that person and i even notified the authorities lest he ""morphed"" my images or leaked even those images that he took. I got a phone call from (+25 something number) which i found to be from Africa the previous Monday. Whatever he does or his team member (which i am sure he has) in the near future i guarantee this i will go lengths to catch someone like this who dares make a mockery of people who are willing to be friends with the likes of him.

This is a huge catch 22 . as far as Skype support knows it could very well be you who are trying to get ownership of someone elses account, and a first step could be to get that person to link your microsoft account to his or hers skype account, a person who doesn't know anything about how skype works, could think that it is equivalent to add someone as a friend on facebook... once that is done, it is easy to make a payment as ""proof"".&nbsp;they need a fair amount if info, like when you created your skype account.

Let's flood them with such comments via that route, different to this forum.I did exactly this. You are right that we probably should use different routes, other than this forum, to make our voices heard. There are probably thousands of negative comments about the 7.X interface in this forum, but very little has been done in the last 6 months to address the main issues. To me the two main issues with the UI are1) the ""bubbles"", where text is typed (color, alignment of the text, their non-optional presence)2) the use of space / size of elements, both in the chat and in the side panels, that clearly has been designed with a touch interface in mind, and brief chit-chat text messages&nbsp;à la ""WhatsApp"" on a smartphone, but is unsuitable to any other use (professional, students, university, gamers/role-plays, story-teller, long chat sessions).All the tweaks the Skype team have made,&nbsp;claiming&nbsp;(pretending?) they were addressing the complaints from the users, were just that, tweaks. They did not take on the real issues...&nbsp;At this point, after this quite long time and after 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and now 7.4 iterations,&nbsp;this clearly represents a development/strategic choice of the Skype Team. Therefore, it is probably worth to try to spread the dissatisfaction feedbacks to other Microsoft divisions.

SkypeCommunityHistory,7946,Skype on Mac OS X 10.5.8 suddenly stopped working ...,"We're sorry to hear that this has caught you off guard. As you pointed out, we began the process of dropping support for 10.5 about&nbsp;9 months&nbsp;ago. At this point, that process has been completed and you are no longer able to use Skype on Leopard. We&nbsp;sent out several emails warning about this, as well as providing an alert on Skype Home.  &nbsp;  At this point, your only option to continue using Skype for Mac is to upgrade to 10.6. Apple charges $20 for this upgrade, and you can get it here:&nbsp;http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-?x-106-snow-leopard  &nbsp;  You can of course continue to use Skype on other platforms, including iOS and Android. You could also create&nbsp;a Skype Number to call your fiancee (and another to have you fiancee&nbsp;call you) using the PSTN phone network. This wouldn't involve video, but could still be cheaper than placing an international call directly. You can purchase these things on the Skype website by logging in using your Skype name.  &nbsp;  If you want to use video chat, you will need to upgrade your OS. As covered in another thread on this topic, Skype is the last major VOIP provider to drop support for Leopard. More information on why we have done this is available here:  &nbsp;  https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34492/is-skype-?for-mac-being-discontinued-on-mac-os-x-10-5-leopar?..."

SkypeCommunityHistory,8084,Skype Number Billing - Someone from Skype PLEASE h...,"I signed up for a Skype Number in August through the facebook login. The same day I signed up and paid, I inadvertently deleted the FB access (was cleaning up FB apps) and thus lost access to the Skype account. (Went back and forth with someone from Skype via email and was finally told there was nothing they could/would do and I lost my money.) Anyway, today, I noticed a charge for $12.05 on my debit card from Skype. Looking back through my account, I have been charged every three months for this since August. I checked my spam folder in my email, and sure enough, I have an email from Skype as a receipt for the Skype number from the account I cannot access. I've searched everywhere for a way to contact Skype, but it seems that without an account, I can't get ahold of anyone. So, while I'm paying for an account, I don't technically have an account I can use to contact them. Could someone at Skype PLEASE get in contact with me! I hate to have to cancel my debit card to make this recurring payment go away.&nbsp;Edited to add: I ended up having to sign up for a free account just to post this here. Help please!!!"

The call will then usually connect, if not, try again.&nbsp;&nbsp;When lockscreen is off Skype picks up fine under 4.4.4 generally, and especially under Slimkat, although there as well I have at some times been forced to hang up and call again - the screen being off apparently throws it somehow?&nbsp;&nbsp;Under 4.4.4 it also has no problems with a covered proximity sensor, while under 5.1 this seems to have the same effect as a lock screen and crashes the app on incoming call.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to summarize the new stuff&nbsp;App does not crash on ""broken"" call under SlimKat 4.4.4App does however drop call on pickup, apparently without telling the caller.&nbsp;If caller then hangs up and re-calls while the screen is still awake, the call usually connects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either this behavior is related to the screen lock itself, or to the Skype app not being ""awake"" enough in the background under certain circumstances?&nbsp;"

SkypeCommunityHistory,8385,Not receiving messages or calls from one contact a...,"So, recently I had some trouble with my internet connection (we figured out it was only the modem) and after the problem was fixed I've been having this problem with just one contact of mine. We were in the middle of a conversation when it seemed that he randomly went offline. I know his internet isn't the greatest and occassionally gets knocked out, but everything was fine that day. When he came back online I received no reply from him, for a week this went on. I would send a message, no reply, no call either. At first I thought he just didn't want to talk, until I got a hold of him over facebook where he told me that he thought I was the one not replying to him!After the confusion was cleared up, we realized that our messages and calls were not getting through to the other person for some unknown reason (though every other contact of ours can get through with no problem). I have tried resetting skype, signing out and back on, a lot of things to see if anything would help but we still cannot receieve any messages from each other and calls won't go through either.&nbsp;Would anyone happen to have the same issue and know what to do, or suggestions we can try to get this back up and working?We can also see each other go on and offline like all other contacts, we just can't communicate for some reason.Thanks to anyone who helps!"
SkypeCommunityHistory,8388,Help Please: Password reset system DOES NOT work--...,"Wow, in all my years of being online (and I've been online since the pre-Internet bulletin board days), Skype ""Support"" has to rank as one of the most exasperating, stress-inducing, user-unfriendly experiences I've ever had.I recently got an email from Skype saying basically, ""Hey, you haven't logged in to your account for a while..."" Since I was unsure as to the status of my account since Microsoft took over, I wanted to confirm a few things. So I go to the website and click on Forgot your Skype Name?. The site sends me a special ""token"" in order to view my username, but the token proves to be invalid: clicking the link in the email from Skype brings me to an error page declaring that this is an ""Invalid Security Token"" (or something very similar). Trying manual entry of the code causes the same error.Then I try the Forgot password? link, THREE times. Every single time Skype declares that the code/token (that they have just sent me seconds ago!) is INVALID. So after wasting 15 minutes or so with this nonsense, I head over to Skype's support page to see if anybody can tell me what's going on. A quick search of the ""Community"" forum brings up DOZENS of relevant posts going back to 2011, in which people--understandably suffering from various degrees of frustration--describe the exact problem I'm having. I also discover that apparently nobody from Skype actually reads or cares about the forum posts, because not a single one of these people were given either an explanation or a resolution to their problem, which is unconscionable considering that this problem with password-reset tokens has been going on for at least 2 years!I then try contacting support directly but discover that in order to do that, you have to log in to Skype. REALLY? Did the wizards at Skype ever consider that some of the people who need support could have a problem which prevents them from logging in to Skype in the first place?!? Maybe the system is intentionally designed this way so that Skype doesn't have to bother replying to these people. (Maybe some guy brought this up at one of the development meetings, and the reply was, ""Mmm, what happens when they can't log in, you ask? Well...I guess...um...Screw 'em! And then everybody had a good laugh.)I had to create a new, additional Skype account just to post this-- a ridiculously convoluted waste of time for someone who just wants a simple answer. I guess I'm also an idiot for even bothering to post this, because judging from all the other identical posts which went completely unanswered (or given useless answers), this one will probably be ignored as well.But anyway, here goes nothing....QUESTION: How does one retrieve their password and access their Skype account, when the password-reset system does not properly function?If the answer is, ""Get in touch with customer service"", then the question becomes: How do you contact customer service without logging in to your account, which CANNOT be done?&nbsp;So...In the slim chance that somebody with the ability or desire to help actually reads this and offers a viable solution, then I sincerely THANK YOU IN ADVANCE."
SkypeCommunityHistory,8555,How to Download / Save Received Video Messages on ...,"Hi all, I found a&nbsp;tutorial&nbsp;on how to download received video messages on Skype for Desktop. I was able to follow the instructions and use the ""database browser"" software to open the .db file, locate the URL of a video I received, and download it in Chrome.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I've noticed a bug&nbsp;where within a conversation, some messages appear in Modern Skype but not in Skype for Desktop. Unfortunately, a video I received last July appears in my Modern (Windows 8.1) Skype, however does not appear in my messages history on Skype for Desktop. In my case, Skype for Desktop shows messages from a few days before and a few days after, but the received video can only be found in Modern Windows Skype. This is problematic because the previous method for saving received videos (opening the .db file) only seems to work for legacy Skype (Desktop Version). Anyone know what I can do?&nbsp;Thanks!&nbsp;P.S. - This is completely unrelated, but I am astounded that Skype does not allow you to change your username.

It worked. I never felt the need for a third party application.&nbsp;In the past several months, you have bastardized Skype for iOS beyond recognition, rendering it near useless. Multiple threads exist on the issues with push notifcations yet nothing has been resolved, despite the fact you could offer a solution in the form of a rollback, even as a second application*.&nbsp;*Roll back to the last working version, the one that ran on iOS prior to your acquisition and update. Revert your code base. Release it as a seperate app. It works - it isn't broken. I currently keep a 3GS hooked up just because it's the only device I own that hasn't been forced to upgrade to this monstrosity.&nbsp;Sadly, you have killed off SkypeKit; something I never needed before. I was looking into third party alternatives that would actually work for push notifcations, and allow me to use either the REAL IM sound for Skype, or an alternative that was more obvious than this tiny ""ding"" than is useless and not distinctive at all. Finding none, as a developer, I investigated how I might write an application for my own personal use to fix this issue as it's a day-to-day stress for me - I miss international friends sending messages and I can't do a thing about it - I just have to hope I am at my computer, you don't allow any of us options to fix the issues you introduced, and forced us to suffer through with mandating we must update. (Yes, I could have them switch to something like Oovoo or any number of other options but I'm resisting as I'm somewhat attached to Skype, it kept me close to loved ones the past several years.)&nbsp;Skype is a free service at the current time, minus credit for calls to phones - so I am conflicted about requesting even a mediocre level of support, as I understand the principle of ""you get what you pay for"", however you've butchered a once great application - your App Store rating has plummeted to 2.5 stars &nbsp;Please, fix this horrific monstrosity you've created in place of the once great Skype app for iOS - push notifications work on every other messaging service, from Facebook to Google Talk to WhatsApp to ... well, literally every other app I have installed except Skype. It isn't an iOS issue, it's not a network issue on the user end, it's not a problem with settings - you broke something, badly, in the same update in which you changed the Skype sound for IM on iOS. PLEASE consider doing something about it, all the threads are depressing, the suggestions near useless, and it's genuinely upsetting to a point of near-tears for those of us who return to our desks after an hour off making lunch or catching up on a TV show only to find we've missed a loved-one on the other side of the world who is now offline.&nbsp;If you roll back to the working, pre-microsoft version, I'd happily buy it as a $9.99 download. At this point, I'd pay that per MONTH if you'd just fix whatever your broke with push notifications and give us the option of using the proper Skype sound.&nbsp;I'm fully aware this may come off as a whiny rant, however I am feeling incredibly whiny - I'm getting incredibly fed up with waking up to find I've missed friends who I really want to talk to. (Yes, the 3GS is a good solution, but being a former test device and very beat up and old, it sometimes has its own, non-Skype issues that impact Skype.)&nbsp;TL;DR - You are a large company, dedicate one Obj-C engineer to your busted push notifications on Skype for iOS, because they're a cause of extreme frustration for thousands, as per the many, many threads in this forum, or announce that you have no intention of fixing said issues, so we can all start finding alternatives and forcing them on our friends, family and colleagues, which will suck, but eventually become the norm and allow for reliable mobile communication.&nbsp;Thank you,&nbsp;Peach Pellen"
SkypeCommunityHistory,10826,Skype Status Keeps Changing From Invisible Back To...,"This issue has been driving me insane.&nbsp;On my PC I hated the new version of skype and thus reverted to version 6.21 (however I did briefly use the most recent version). Skype on my PC retains my Invisible status usually, but if I sign in via my cell phone, my PC Skype status changes to 'Available' which I really never want. There are many times when I'm signed into both as I don't bother logging out on my PC usually, but will respond to messages from my cell if I'm away from the computer.&nbsp;I believe the key to the entire mess is the extremely frustrating mobile Skype app, which ALWAYS automatically signs me in as Available. The moment I open the app, it changes my status to Available and I have to manually switch it to Invisible. This gets extremely old as each time I turn my phone screen back on to check Skype mobile, it has to log me back in and I continually have to manually change my status back to Invisible.&nbsp;Seriously, this issue has been going on for years based on my google search on this topic. How difficult can it possibly be to have an option for mobile Skype to always log you in as invisible?Since Microsoft seems completely unwilling to fix this issue and nobody has come up with a satisfactory work around, I have to wonder if using a program like Trillian or some other such IM service would allow me to remain invisible."

If you really want people to use your services, Microsoft, you should remove this ridiculous loop from your system.    The most commong problem in all these cases is the following:    A user signed up for Skype account ""john.doe456"" a few years ago using an email address john.doe@email.com  Later the user linked their Microsoft account&nbsp;john.doe@outlook.com to the Skype account  Now it's March 2015 and they try to reset their Skype account password and request a password reset using the&nbsp;john.doe@outlook.com email.    Users will always be forwarded to the Microsoft account password recovery. To reset the Skype account password&nbsp;you need to request the password recovery to the&nbsp;john.doe@email.com registered email address of the Skype account. Many users have forgotten&nbsp;what their Skype account registered email was because they haven't updated them for long.

SkypeCommunityHistory,11043,Massive Adspace Column in Skype 7.2.0.103 (Windows...,"Updating to the latest Skype version was a massive mistake that I intend to redact by going back to the last version. Whoever thought it was a good idea to harass users with a massive adspace column on the right that takes up almost a quarter of the screen when in fullscreen should be fired immediately. Yes, I am aware that ""supposedly"" it goes away if you purchase a subscription or a minimal amount of credit, but I'm hearing that even that doesn't always work.&nbsp;This avertising column takes up roughly a quarter of my screen on a 15.6"" 1280x800 laptop display. I shudder to think of how terrible it must scale on smaller or larger screens. This results in a crimped text space that ends up making messages take up more vertical space, and therefore limiting the amount of content that can be seen on screen.&nbsp;Not everybody is using Skype because we love its VoIP or video chat functionality. Most of the people I know are only using it because Microsoft killed Windows Live Messenger, which was by far the superior instant messaging product. Even to this day, features are still missing from Skype that were in WLM nearly four years ago, if not even further back. All rambling aside, what I'm saying is that for those of us that primarily use it for an instant messaging program, purchasing Skype credit/subscriptions is a waste of money for a feature we wouldn't even use. I only occasionally do video chats or voice calls; to shell out money just to remove the massive adspace column would be wasteful.&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Skype team to come up with some other solution for ad revenue. Placing this oversized advertising column only seems like an unethical tactic to gain money from people who might not need all the features Skype has to offer, like myself. Even reducing the size the column takes up by half would be a major improvement. I understand that Microsoft has to make money off the back of Skype users that do not pay somehow, but I refuse to support such unethical business tactics, and so have blocked the g.msn.com and apps.skype.com advertising domains until such time as Microsoft is ready to remove or reduce the size of the advertising column.&nbsp;I implore those of you who feel the same way to come forward and make your opinions vocal. Let's let Microsoft know that we will not stand for this abuse of their platform. Skype is rapidly declining in quality, so we must let them know that the keys to a successful product is to listen to the customer's complaints and/or feedback."
SkypeCommunityHistory,11178,The elephant in every electronic digital device on...,"Why is it not a accessable feature to handle chat history in skype?  I do know you can clear your history if you really want to but the way it's done today a lot of users actually have to ask for directions on the internet, and not just google it, actual community posts. So I wonder. As a webdesigner and programmer, what is my first priority in a advertisement driven service? Function. What is function, you ask, well it's accomplishing a task as unnoticable as possible while using as little energy and space while you do it. That will always be the role of a function, or an entire program, atleast if you look at the code. &nbsp;So why is it not already a readily available function in the current user interface layout? People are very fond of their private life, and even though we all know the actual data isn't removed we can breath out that the wrong person doesn't get the opportunity to know every sentence we speak with people we know every time you leave a device in the open.  &nbsp;xxxxxx Make it either a option to erase history on cykle, on exit or even make it a xxxxxx keyboard shortcut but don't make it a borderl line advanced option setting that differs from client platform! That must be the worst place to put it!  &nbsp;  I do realise that because you've combined Skype with Facebook and more or less taken the role MSN had, you could be dealing with ownership and morale differences&nbsp;amongst yourselfs and that only makes this a very probably relative&nbsp;function, but not in any way hard/impossible. I don't think, I certainly hope that I'm alone in my opinions about the current solution for chat/call history and I hope I&nbsp;get atleast a few&nbsp;supportive&nbsp;comments. Dare I hope for answers about future features in this post? Time will tell.  &nbsp;  Yours truly, Mjölnir  &nbsp;"

However, when I entered into the recover skype account info box this email address [e-mail removed for privacy and security] - it took me away from skype and to the microsoft password recovery center. That is either a bug or a feature, and it's extremely confusing either way.&nbsp;That differs from expected behavior because I would expect that, if I entered in an incorrect email address into the email recovery field, that it would tell me that the account is not associated with Skype. A quick test confirms that behavior - if I enter a fake email address like:[e-mail removed for privacy and security]into the password recovery field, then it gives me an error message 'That email account is not in our records.' Instead, when I enter [e-mail removed for privacy and security] (for which there is no skype account), it takes me to Microsoft password recovery with no explanation.&nbsp;A simple message seems like it would help us here:'That account is not associated with a Skype account but it does have a Microsoft account.

The latest patch from Microsoft Update not being current? Whoulda thunk it! In any event, I simply launched Skype without updating again.

And after having no choice but to move onto Skype, I was greatly disappointed by the poor and limited emoticons available. To be quite honest, they suck so much that neither I or any of my friends even use them. It used to be really different and fun to be able to use your own custom emoticons, because you'd have your own person collection of them that you could send to anyone, anywhere. It never ever got boring and I feel this is something that Skype GREATLY lacks.&nbsp;Perhaps this is something that is difficult to accomplish in skype and perhaps requires a lot of software work, however i feel it would really be worth all the effort to add this feature and surely will benefit you and all skype users happier with their skype experiences.I would not believe that this is something that can't be done, because MSN messenger was capable of having it and i believe Skype is ought to be far more advanced, however as of yet &nbsp;I still think skype is inferior to MSN mainly due to this reason.At least please add this function for PC/laptop if it is too hard for mobile. (although if facebook is able to display advanced smileys in its messenger, then again im not sure why skype couldn't)Thank you for reading and I sincerely hope this suggestion will be considered and that you'll add this function! &nbsp;&nbsp;"

Skype developers, if you ever do read this, please realize people with no funds to upgrade to high end PCs use low-end hardware. Please do not develop new software that is NOT needed in the slightest with new UIs that look horrible and take up far too much space.&nbsp;Skype, you are a dictator - the only reason you can make such horrible changes is becasue there is no widely used alternative. Back on teh topic of CPU usage, just because modern PCs have the capability of running intensive programs does not mean you have to make your program more intensive. A better program is one that uses minimal hardware.&nbsp;I'm probably wasting my time writing this but seriously, even my i5 laptop can't respond properly when opening Skype."

A desktop computer (artisanal, Windows 7), my Sony Xperia Z1 phone, a Nexus 7 (Android 5) tablet, an Asus Transformer Book T100A (Windows 8.1), and a &nbsp;Philips Skype phone with an independent wifi connection.&nbsp;It doesn't ring on my phone, which has the Stamina battery saving system, although I have Skype whitelisted out of that process, which hibernates apps when the phone's screen it not active; I would expect it to ring when a Skype call comes in, even if the screen isn't active. The desktop is usually turned off altogether, unless I'm working, so I wouldn't expect it to ring there.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I have my laptop turned on, a Skype call will ring on the tablet, even if it's not in use (asleep), on the Philips phone, and on the Transformer Book laptop. If I answer on the laptop, a few minutes later, the tablet will dial the person who called me. If we're still talking, they'll say, ""Are you still there? Then why are you calling me back?"" To get it to stop ringing, I have to find the tablet, open it, open Skype, and terminate the call, which leaves me still connected on the Transformer Book. I find this so bizarre, but it happens every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like all Skype calls to always ring on my phone, because even if I'm away from home for a week, the Philips Skype phone at home is always on, and obviously Skype thinks I'm using it. I also would like my phone to pass on notifications to my Pebble Smart watch, which it can't do if the call doesn't ring on the phone.&nbsp;"

If I select to use headphones as the speakers in the audio settings and unplug them, the audio from the call will not stream from the laptop speakers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i. Prior to the problem, if I unplugged my headphones, Skype would automatically adjust to stream the call audio from the laptop speakers instead.&nbsp;7.

SkypeCommunityHistory,23456,Skype Permissions - Way too intrusive!!! Record au...,"Hi!&nbsp;When I updated my Skype App, I took a bit of time to read the permissions you guys ask for and they are more intrusive than I could ever imagine!!!What do you mean by ""Allows the App to modify the data about your contacts stored on your phone, INCLUDING THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH YOU'VE CALLED, EMAILED OR COMMUNICATED IN OTHER WAYS WITH SPECIFIC CONTACTS"". Why do you possibly need to modify this type of metadata?? Isn't it enough that you have permission to look at it and store it?&nbsp;And how about the ""Record audio"" permission? I am very concerned because I just gave you permission ""to record audio with the microphone"" and ""this permission allows the app TO RECORD AUDIO AT ANY TIME WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION"" (that is, my confirmation). I have a few questions:1. Why do you need to record my audio?2. What do you mean by ""at anytime""? Does it mean the microphone of my phone can all of a sudden be activated if Skype is running in the background? Because the words can be so easily interpreted that way.3. Why can't you ask for my confirmation to actually record my audio, if you really want to hear what I am talking about?&nbsp;Do I really have to give away the comfort of knowing I am not recored at any time just to be able to talk via wi-fi to friends who are far away?&nbsp;It is just so, so, so upsetting. &nbsp;                                                                                                                  Solved!

I have searched high and low and can see no policy change at all mentioned anywhere?Fortunately, today I was able to find an alternative number for my bank using a popular stop 0870 site, but that is not always the case.If the policy has not changed, what is the issue? As I said, I have skype credit as well as my subscription and it's on autotopup too.If it has changed, when was this change and why is no announcement in evidence?Thanks."

SkypeCommunityHistory,23477,Recieving IMs from Strangers Despite Privacy Setti...,"First and foremost, I'm making this post on behalf of my mother because she asked me to see if I can find out what's been going on with her skype account.&nbsp;Alrighty, with that bit of information taken care of, hello there! I have a really strange Skype problem that I can't seem to find the solution to. This Skype account keeps recieving IMs from random people (scammers, spammers, and a calvacade of foreign men trying to make my mother their bride), despite the security settings being set to ""recieve IMs from people in my contact list only."" My Skype account (which is different from this one), never has this problem. Ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd researched this and I found that at one point (or maybe still currently) people have been having issues with Skype settings not sticking, but the thing is that the settings are not autoreverting back to ""anyone."" At least in terms of what radio button is clicked. I've included screenshots of the privacy settings below.&nbsp;I have set this feature in both IM Settings and Privacy settings, though it seems very strange that the setting shows up twice. (Then again, AIM clients also do the same thing, so I'm not going to question it too much.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMs persist, though, despite turning the settings to ""anyone"" and then turning them back to ""people in my contact list only,"" I tried the go ""Offline"" for 5-10 seconds and then reset your settings again and it didn't work either. It's frustrating because some days she'll leave Skype up and come back to upwards of 10-15 IMs from strangers, some of them really crass, rude, and crude, others are obvious scammers trying to get her credit card number (which she wouldn't, obviously.) It's something that I'd like to get taken care of because she wants to use Skype to talk to her best friend who lives several states away without fear of being hastled by dozens of strangers, and I'm going to be going back to college here in the near future and she wants to be able to skype with me as well.&nbsp;Any idea how to fix this?"

Welcome to Skype Live Support! My name is Albert. How may I help you?Stephen:&nbsp;So my other (primary) Skype account has been blocked for ""unsolicited communications"" but I have not sent any such thing from that account. I keep trying to get an explanation of what happened to my account but I am not getting much help through filling out the customer service form online.Stephen:&nbsp;I would like to know what happened to my Skype account ([Redacted for privacy]) and why it can't be activated and what I can do to resume my Skype services (they are very important for my day to day activities)Alberto F:&nbsp;I understand that your account has been blocked for unsolicited communication and want to get it unblocked. I'd be happy to assist you with it.Alberto F:&nbsp;To make sure I am pulling up the right account, may I have your Skype name and first name please?Stephen:&nbsp;Thank you, I appreciate any help you can provide. I haven't been able to make any calls for three days now.Stephen:&nbsp;The Skype name is [Redacted for privacy] and my name is&nbsp; [Redacted for privacy]Alberto F:&nbsp;Thank you Stephen.Stephen:&nbsp;YepAlberto F:&nbsp;Thank you for waiting Stephen.&nbsp;Stephen:&nbsp;No problemAlberto F:&nbsp;We apologize, but for the security and privacy of your account, your account is restricted at the momentStephen:&nbsp;That is a canned response. Why can't anyone tell me why my account is blocked? I just activated it two weeks ago and I AM THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS USED IT.Stephen:&nbsp;I keep getting the runaround from you guys. I am told that my account is blocked but nothing else. Not how to reactivate my account. Why it is blocked. What I can do. If I can start a new account.&nbsp;Alberto F:&nbsp;As described in the Skype Privacy Statement (http://www.skype.com/en/legal/privacy), we are only able to provide account information or make changes in the account, in cases where we are able to verify the account user’s identity. Unfortunately, due to lack of information required, we will not be able to help you to access the accountStephen:&nbsp;I am getting very very few solutions from you guys at all. I have payed you my money and I am not able to get barely any response from customer serivece.&nbsp;Alberto F:&nbsp;Online verification formStephen:&nbsp;That doesn't make any sense: ""Unfortunately, due to lack of information required, we will not be able to help you to access the account"" you have not asked me for any information but my name and login. Ask me anything: what do you need to know?Alberto F:&nbsp;Once you submit the form, the information will be forwarded to a special department for review. You will receive a follow up email within 24 hours.&nbsp;Stephen:&nbsp;I have submitted that form three times now, I am not doing it again. This is crap. Are you a human or a machine? You keep typing out canned responses.&nbsp;Stephen:&nbsp;Why can't I reactivate my account? &lt;--- see direct question, it's easy to answer. Like this question: Q: what color is the sky A: Blue. See, easy.Stephen:&nbsp;This is the response I am getting from you guys: What color is the sky? Answer from skype: ""Please refer to our ""sky colors"" link to look at possible colors that the sky may or may not be""Alberto F:&nbsp;I apologize Stephen, As much as I want to process your request now, we really need to go through the user verification form. This is to protect the privacy and security of your account. I assure you that once we receive the results of the user verification form, you will receive a follow up email as soon as possible.&nbsp;Stephen:&nbsp;Yes, I received a ""follow up email"" three times now. And three times I have been told ""we are sorry but we cannot reactivate your account"".&nbsp;Stephen:&nbsp;Why would I contact you guys again only to be told off again?Stephen:&nbsp;Can you just take the remainder of my service and apply it to this account? I paid for a month of service, I still have 10 days that I haven't utilized (14 if you count the days I haven't been able to use the service).Alberto F:&nbsp;That is because the answers you have provided regarding the account might not be accurateStephen:&nbsp;BullStephen:&nbsp;I am the only one that knows the answers to the questions you guys asked and I answered all of them as best as I could. I don't know every single phone number and contact in my list by heart but I provided all the information that I could possibly provide.Stephen:&nbsp;Three times now.Alberto F:&nbsp;I'm sorry, since your account is restricted, we cannot access it at the moment.Stephen:&nbsp;Okay, why was my account restricted in the first place? Huh, can you tell me that? I didn't do anything. So what is it that my account supposedly did? Did I send a threatening email to the president? Did I declare war on Russia? Did I offend Bill Gates? What? I have been given nothing but shoirt, vague responses from you guys.Stephen:&nbsp;I have literally used the **bleep** thing for TWO WEEKS. I haven't used my Skype account in a year and all of a sudden you guys decide to screw me over?Alberto F:&nbsp;The skype name you have provided is [Redacted for privacy] and it is currently restrictedStephen:&nbsp;Are you really not a machine?Stephen:&nbsp;You didn't answer any of my **bleep** questions.Stephen:&nbsp;Yes you and I both know [Redacted for privacy] is restricted and I know what my account name is :/Stephen:&nbsp;So why say it like that?Stephen:&nbsp;Are you not allowed to answer questions or be helpful being a Skype rep?Stephen:&nbsp;I asked why you blocked my account in the first place. Acceptable responses could be: ""because we hate you"", ""because, haha, we have your money sucker"", ""because your account appears to have been hacked and we have locked it to protect you"", ""because we thought it would be funny"". See these are all ANSWERS.Alberto F:&nbsp;I'm sorry, we are only concerned about the privacy and security of your accountStephen:&nbsp;What is your name?Alberto F:&nbsp;I'm Albert.Stephen:&nbsp;CONGRATULATIONS ALBERT! YOU JUST ANSWERED A QUESTION! Now please answer a question that isn't your **bleep** name. Why is my account blocked? Why reason? Details, that is what I want to know. It is only fair to me. I don't understand why this is soooo difficult for you guys.Alberto F:&nbsp;Your account was restricted as it violated our Terms of Use.&nbsp;Stephen:&nbsp;How did it violate the ToU?Alberto F:&nbsp;Skype Terms of UseStephen:&nbsp;""UNSOLICITED COMMUNICATIONS""? AS PER PART 6 SECTION 3?&nbsp;Alberto F:&nbsp;Kindly read through it. I cannot see on my end the exact reason why it was blockedStephen:&nbsp;See if this was a court case, the judge would ask the attorney: what did the defendant do"" and the attorney would say ""your honor he was speeding""Stephen:&nbsp;Ohhhhhh, so you guys can block my account but not give me a reason? Just point to a vague subsection in a ToU?Stephen:&nbsp;That is bullcrap.Alberto F:&nbsp;What I would advise you is to fill up the Online form and answer all of the questions accurately inorder for your account to be verified.Stephen:&nbsp;I am completely angry now. This is unfair. I have done nothing wrong. Not only has Skype customer support been woefully incompetent at telling me why my account was blocked, but I am not even given any options AS A PAYING CUSTOMER as to how I can resume my service, a very important service that I use and PAY YOU MONEY FORStephen:&nbsp;I paid you guys money for a service that you decided to randomly terminate, and now you are giving me the giant runaround. I have contacted Skype via the Online form three times now and all three times I have received an unhelpful canned response telling me to kindly screw off. I am tired of this. I can't believe how much I am being screwed right now.Alberto F:&nbsp;We can only answer your question and assist you if your account is authenticated.Stephen:&nbsp;I have my social security number, I can send you a picture of my birth certificate, what else do you need?

SkypeCommunityHistory,23706,Skype Manager's Admin cannot take back Credit from...,"I just know that Skype has an internal language and actually define customers into 2 types, consumer and business. not all members inside a Skype Manager account are defined as business account. Just members created inside a Skype manager account are belonged to business account. Skype's reason to setup these 2 type is to prevent allocating credit between these 2 types of account. In term of safety, I generally agree.&nbsp;But the interesting point is:&nbsp;Skype Manager's Admin usually cannot take back Credit from its account to the main pool and re-allocate to other members. Admin can only re-allocate credits among other created business members.The cause is: People are usually exisiting Skype users (classified as consumer type) before they further enable Skype manager service. And after they setup Skype manager and become its Admin, it is ever still consumer account and&nbsp;cannot take back its credit to the main pool and then re-allocate to other members or staffs. Allowing this actually doesn't affect any safety issue, since they are Admin! This is a design bug of Skype manager system.&nbsp;Skype has written this rule in its FAQ section:&gt;&gt; To take back all the Skype Credit currently allocated to one or more members with business accounts.&nbsp;Who knows what its self definition of ""business accounts""? Skype should make remark on the&nbsp;direct interface!&nbsp;Anyway, it is my 1st time. &nbsp;I waste 1.5 hour in connecting Skype and request solving this issue, no matter permanently or manually. But&nbsp;Skype is so rigid and even don't agree to solve my this problem manually. As a business customer, I feel extremely frustrated on Skype and Microsoft's services, and hesitate to use their product and service in the future. I need to re-consider if I should change to some open SIP platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

SkypeCommunityHistory,23758,Skype for desktop very slow to send and receive me...,"Recently Skype has been incredibly slow to recieve messages. Also sending can take a long time.&nbsp; If someone send me a message I receive it on my Windows 8 phone instantly. This is presumably still using the old Messenger transport. My Skype for desktop doesn't receive the same message for an hour or more sometimes which is really quite confusing!Similarly if I send a message from my PC&nbsp;the recipient doesn't get it immediately and in fact I have one still sitting in my message window which I sent several hours ago. It has a little blue rotating circle and hovering the mouse over it shows ""Not delivered yet"" and yet the user was online at the time I sent it and remained online for around two hours. Now he is offline and the little circle is still twiddling away. The same twiddly circle also appears on my other PC which is also incredibly slow to send and receive. One is Win7 the other is WinXP.

SkypeCommunityHistory,23790,Skype is the most user-UNFRIENDLY site on the face...,"I just joined Skype, and it is certainly not user-friendly. I want to learn how to call someone on Skype. No info anywhere. Eventually I find ""How to call someone on your contacts list."" What contacts list? How do I create one? Beats me. But it does tell me to ""Click on Contacts"" Um, no tab anywhere on my home page that says ""Contacts.""So I decide to ask the Community, right? Instructions: ""Take a look at the Board Listings."" What board listings? Where? How do I find them? Beats me. So I click on a random post just to be able to fulfill the instruction that tells me ""Just click the green ""New Topic"" button on top of a board to start a new topic."" Great - now I'm getting somewhere, right? Wrong. No ""New Topic"" button to be found on the post.If Skype had any genuine compettion they would be out of business in a week. Is it too much to ask for a list of simple clear instructions to what are bound to be obvious questions from a new user?I don't even know where or how to post this, so I'm just sticking it in as a reply to some random post in the hope that someone here will help.It just got worse - trying to post a comment where it says ""Post a Comment"" it tells me to ""Sign in"" despite the fact that I was already signed in. So I signed in again, went back to ""Post a Comment"" and was told again I have to sign in. This goes on ad infinitum. Unbelievable. Wait - now I see that any time I go to any new window it then tells me to ""Sign In."" Any new page. So then I managed to find a post that gave the option ""Reply to Post."" Hot Ziggety - at least maybe someone will see my post and offer some help. Sure LOL - I click on ""Reply to Post"" - guess what, it sends me yet again to the ""Sign In"" page. This is genuinely preposterous."

But now there is no such option at all anymore, all of my clients (android and desktop) have reset for some reason, prompting me to input my Skype password which I have forgotten, stupidly. But resetting my Skype password simply never shows up as an option anywhere (not even btw for my old Skype account which I never linked up with Microsoft, but still only lets me reset or sign in with Microsoft).&nbsp;TL;DR: Can't reset SKYPE PASSWORD as customer support continuously keep sending me a link to reset my Microsoft password which I don't need to reset.&nbsp;Anyone got any idea how to get out of this loop? Please?&nbsp;"

SkypeCommunityHistory,23903,Problem with Skype-app (WP8) incorrectly linked to...,"I have a PC with my long-time-back Skype-account, where I log-in with my original Skype-name and password (not yet link'ed to a Microsoft-account, - I dare not, after all the phone problems).Then I have recently got a Nokia 920 cellphone with WP8, where I have had a Skype-app, which worked fine. I logged in with the same Skype Log-in as on the PC, and all my contacts were there.But after the last Skype-app update (I think), it suddenly asked me if I wanted to log-in via the Microsoft-account, I use on the phone. To that I answered ""No"", and from that something went wrong ?I cannot see my contacts on the phone, from the Skype-account used on the PC, and after a lot of testing and working, I think I maybe have found out, what is wrong.When I said ""No"", there have been created a new Microsoft-account (?), but with the same mail-adress (login-name) as I have used a lot of years on my PC, and which the rest of my WP8 on the phone is also used with.But I cant log-in to the new account, because it seems to have another password, which I never have given it ?.On the phone, I am given no possibility to unlink to the ""unknown"" account, and every time I log-off, and start the app again, I only get the one button with the possibility to ""Log on your Microsoft-account to start"", and not log-in with my old Skype-account.I have tried to uninstall/install the Skype-app on the phone several times, but it changes nothing. I'm not given the possibility to log-in with my Skype-login, as I was the first one-and-only time, after the update, only via a Microsoft-account.That there exist two different accounts in Skype (the ""right"" one, which I can reach with my Skype-login, and the ""wrong"" and empty, which I cant get the phone from logging in to), I base on the fact, that I (as a person) have different names in each of them, and when I'm logged in on the PC, I can search and find the ""wrong"", and make it a contact, which was not possible, if there was only one single account !!? (normally you reasonably cannot create yourself as a contact in Skype&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ).Via the Microsoft-account on the phone, I'm not allowed to unlink or change password, because I'm told that my name/password is wrong, when I try to use the original Microsoft name/password, that I few minutes before had used to start Skype on the phone !?? Very confusing...Seems to me that there is a bug in the programming somewhere, maybe in the effort to get everybody on Skype away from their old Skype-login, and on to the Microsoft-login?I can of course give you details about the two accounts, their names, and the mail-adress, but will not do, here in public. Please contact me via my ""right"" Skype-account.Could you please help me to unlink to, or get rid of the ""wrong"" and empty Microsoft-account, so I can use Skype on my Nokia again, thanks !Soeren JohannessenAarhus DenmarkWP8-version: 8.0.10517.150Skype version on phone: 2.19.0.172Skype version on PC: 6.16.0.105                                                                                                                  Solved!

So you have the choice of going back to an older version of Skype or disabling the webcam / driver through Device Manager. As soon as you disable the driver / device Skype will install / start - but of course you won't be able to use video during Skype calls.&nbsp;Hopefully Microsoft / Skype will fix the driver incompatibility in a future release. &nbsp;Skype Support - the issue is with the HP / Sonix driver - file is snp2uvc.sys&nbsp;There are similar issues reported with a previous version of the HP HD Webcam driver as well (SPUVCBv_x64.sys).&nbsp;Please fix it.

I know my username but forgotten password / hit forgot pwd link / entered account email / received code in email / copy and pasted code into code textbox / hit submit or send whatever it is!&nbsp;Result: Skype cannot find an associated account, or words to that effect!&nbsp;I have tried the same process but by sending forgotten pwd code to my mobile in an SMS, the same thing happens! Cannot find my account...&nbsp;So I fear I have lost all my contacts and any credit I may have had left!!!&nbsp;So I assumed my account must be gone! I create a new account using my old username... Result: An account already exists with the username supplied. I very much doubt there is another account with my username as it is too unique, a made up word with meaning only to me. If there is another account with this username it would be a first!More likely however is that my original account still exists, but is failing on an epic scale to allow me to regain access by taking me through the usual automated channels! Or Skype / MS have done some kind of server migration and balls'd it up along the way, which has create some db relational cokc up or something!&nbsp;So.. next I created a whole new account after reluctantly accepting defeat, and pulling my hair out over the bloody stupid impossible task of trying to get some support from these in house MS developed androids who must be working under the control of the evil Mr BG.&nbsp;After I successfully created a new account, guess what.... cant sign in with that account, duno who you are.

SkypeCommunityHistory,24112,Skype 1.8 - Photo viewing and enhanced Snap experi...,"Since we launched Skype for Xbox One*, we’ve been listening to your feedback and continuing to make updates to improve your Skype experience. With this update, we’re excited to add the ability to view photos from mobile devices; we’re also continuing to evolve Snap functionality, which we&nbsp;announced&nbsp;a few months ago.  &nbsp;  Skype 1.8 for Xbox One allows you to view photos sent from mobile phones on Skype for Xbox One. Skype users from Windows Phone and iOS mobile devices can now share pictures with Skype for Xbox One users either in a 1:1 or group chat. If there are multiple photos being shared, you can start a slide show to view all the photos, right on your large screen.  &nbsp;  In addition to photo sharing, we’ve worked hard to bring you more improvements to Skype in Snap mode, such as:    You can now answer a call in Snap mode while using other apps using voice controls. This means, if you’re watching TV or playing a game and you get a Skype call, when you say “Xbox answer,” the call will automatically Snap, and won’t interrupt your TV or gaming experience. Or, if you prefer, you can also change your Skype settings to answer a call in full screen.  Now, you can view your recent and favorite contacts and make calls directly from Skype in Snap mode instead of having to go into the full screen Skype experience.  You’ll also see previews of messages you may have received while Skype is Snapped, and easily go to full screen to respond.  You can sign out of Skype for Xbox One:&nbsp;When on main Skype screen, select your avatar in the upper left and on the bottom of the menu you will see the Sign Out option.&nbsp;Once you sign out,&nbsp;others will see you as Offline (unless you are signed&nbsp;in on another device).    If you have any questions or feedback please share them here on the Community.  &nbsp;  *IMPORTANT! Some apps, including Skype on Xbox One, no longer require an Xbox Live Gold membership. See xbox.com/livefaq. Advanced TV hardware and Kinect sensor required for Skype voice chat and video calling features.                              ? Did my reply answer your question?

However, the updates were slow so I decided it might be better to switch back to the official version.&nbsp;I'm glad to see that version 5 is worse than the modded version 4...&nbsp;The Skype version 5 seems to have introduced a few new issues that I was not experiencing in version 4 or the modded version.&nbsp;In version 4 I sometimes experienced not recieving any notifications or recieving them late and got the feeling that every time you bring up the Skype window it was logging in.&nbsp;It seems that the version 5 that I have does not give any notifications when the app is minimized so I'm not sure if the app is still logged when it is being minimized.I've experienced this by opening the minimized Skype and then a bunch of messages appearing.It would also be good to have an option to enable notification sounds when Skype is open like version 3 had because I sometimes leave Skype open but since there is no sound I don't know when I am recieving a message.&nbsp;I'm also curious to know why you decided to use the statuses Available and Unavailable for android when every other version of skype(pc, ios) uses the normal statuses such as online, away, do not disturb and offline/invisible.&nbsp;I find it annoying since I do have a friend that changes their status to ""Unavailable"" but still talks to me. So at the moment if I'm on my phone I can never really be sure whether they are online or not.&nbsp;I think I may switch back to the modded version in the mean time because at least I can get message notifications sometimes...You can even choose your status: available, away, do not disturb, invisible but others still show as availalbe or unavaiable.&nbsp;It would be great if you could improve these things though I doubt this post will probably make a difference since I had one about the notification issues in Skype 4 back in March haha...At least being able to know I am recieving messages would be good though."

I was his account officer before I rose to the position of Managing Director. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 27th of September 2010.Sadly Mr. Weimin was among the death victims in the September 2009 earthquake in Indonesia that left over 1,200 people dead while he was there on business trip.Since the last quarter of 2010 until today, the management of my bank has been finding means to reach him so as ascertain if he will roll over the Deposit or have the contract sum withdrawn. When I discovered that this will happen, I have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceeds for business.Some directors here have been trying to find out from me the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed because, I know that if they become aware that Mr. Weimin is late, they will corner the funds for themselves. Therefore, am seeking your co-operation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death since you have the same name, so that my bank headquarters will pay the funds to you. I have done enough inside bank arrangement and you only have to put in your details into the information network in the bank computers and reflect you as his next of kin.If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 50% of the funds while 50% shall be for me.

I do not know the vesion of this versionof Skype as it lacks in functionality.&nbsp; It is definitely the worst vesion of Skype that has ever been designed and I have used Skype (approx 2004) almost when it was first created.&nbsp; (Please hire a new design team)&nbsp;I recently downloaded Skype 6.22.81.104 for Windows desktop and added to my Asus laptop because of all the frustrating problems I have had with the pre-installed Skype.&nbsp;Although this version is better in many aspects then the pre-installed version it is lacking of very good features that were on the earlier versions.&nbsp;My first big concern (and I will post each seperately with the same pre-amble) concerns the showing of the local time for contacts.&nbsp;On all previous versions of Skype , the local time of your contact is displayed when you click on their name.&nbsp; This is especially helpful when you are wanting to Skype a relative, friend or associate in some other country.&nbsp; For example I often Skype friends in Australia, Africa and Europe, all different time zones.&nbsp; I don't want to be&nbsp;trying to Skype these people at 03:00, 04:00, 05:00 in the morning when they might be sleeping.&nbsp;I have checked Skpye Help and Community and seen responses to similar questions.&nbsp;The first response was:Status: Already exists&nbsp; ""Thank you for the feedback.

SkypeCommunityHistory,24285,Slowness on chat opening with huge skype history (...,"Hey guys,&nbsp;Looks like i have an issue with skype after 6.22 update. I have a huge chat history. My main.db has ~360mb size. When I open some chat, then it takes 2-10 seconds to open it, and during this opening Skype hungs and ignore all Windows Messages as looks like something is going in UI thread. When I open the same chat again, then it works fine. If i don't open it for 30-60 minutes, and then try to open again, it's again has this delay.&nbsp;I traced it with Process Monitory and looks like when i open it Skype is executing some big SQL lite query over the DB, and this query is processing the whole main.db file by 4kb chunks. Totally it loads ~10-40mb from it in different places of main.db file. Trace is attached&nbsp;Previous version hadn't such issue and it worked fine. I suppose in new version because of UI changes Skype loads some more data statistics for the whole chat history. Probably it loads the whole history, or maybe some common information about it, but it's very annoying.When skype hungs for 10 seconds on each chat opening, especially during call, it's very very very annoying.&nbsp;Is there any way to fix it? Or disable? I suppose i can delete my history, and then it will work fine, but it's not a option for me, because i need that history.&nbsp;UPDATE:I've added one more trace with summary information. 1816 file events in 5 seconds just for main.db file.

SkypeCommunityHistory,24314,Disrespect for Skype Consumers and Waste of Machin...,"Today, I suddenly got ""upgraded"" to yet another new and useless version of Skype which has further degraded the Skype experience with NO DISCERNIBLE BENEFIT.&nbsp;I USED (note the PAST TENSE) Skype on a Windows 7 Dell machine with dual processor and 4 Gbs of RAM.&nbsp;For the past two years I have watched as Skype's performance has continued to DEGRADE my computer to the point that I can no longer afford to have Skype continuously running in the background.&nbsp; The application now grabs upwards of 100 Mbs of system memory, but it is clearly chewing up both system CPU cycles and bandwidth even when I am NOT on a Skype call.&nbsp;About two months ago when performance previously&nbsp;became intolerable, I SIGNED OFF OF SKYPE and CLOSED the application.&nbsp; My computer worked really great for the period I didn't have Skype running.&nbsp; Recently, I needed some messaging service and started Skype back up.&nbsp; The performance problems returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, today, MS added insult to injury by further changing the interface in completely useless ways.&nbsp; Simple things became cumbersome.&nbsp; File transfer didn't work properly.&nbsp; But mostly, the newest implementation made my computer UNRESPONSIVE.&nbsp; So once again, I signed OFF of Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;I signed off of Skype and CLOSED the application again today and regained the utility of my computer.&nbsp; Now I am notifying my regular Skype correspondents, via e-mail, NOT to expect to find me regularly on Skype any more.&nbsp; I am also advising them that I am looking for an alternative and will let them know when I have identified the product / service we will use for future collaboration.&nbsp;It is UNCLEAR TO ME what the people at MS are smoking or just what delusions they are operating under.&nbsp; But my computer does NOT EXIST for the PURPOSE of MS tracking me and using an application to steal machine memory and CPU cycles from applications I really need.&nbsp;I STILL NEED a messaging service.&nbsp; It is clear that it CANNOT BE Skype, because MS has NO RESPECT FOR ITS USERS and NO INTEREST in preserving user experience and satisfaction.&nbsp; I am quite confident that I brought at least forty to fifty users to Skype over the years.&nbsp; Once I identify and settle on an alternative, I am quite confident that at least HALF of these will follow me to an alternative application.&nbsp; I will probably bring at least as many other new users to whichever application I settle upon.&nbsp;*&nbsp;In case anyone at MS actually CARES, there are two rather fundamental flaws in the paradigm under which you are operating as to Skype's evolution.&nbsp;The first FLAW was that those who were previously using Windows Live Messenger had similar messaging interests, goals or objective to those using Skype.&nbsp; Abandoning Live Messenger and forcing a migration of Messenger users to Skype was a HORRIBLE MISTAKE.&nbsp; Those Live Messenger users I knew were TOTALLY dissatisfied with using Skype and simply switched over to using Yahoo Messenger.&nbsp; THEY ARE NOT COMING BACK!&nbsp;In the meantime, MS makes the mistake that somehow it could widen the constituency for Skype by adding features that look more like Live Messenger or Yahoo Messenger.&nbsp; But existing mature Skype customers such as myself (and EVERYONE I communicate with) have NO INTEREST in the nonsensical features that MS wants to add to make the Skype experience more like Windows Live Messenger or Yahoo.&nbsp; Rather than improving experience, MS now alienates and estranges existing users and ultimately will drive enough of these away that the franchise will be completely destroyed.&nbsp;Similarly, MS has made the mistake of believing that desktop, tablet and handheld users have the same or substantially the SAME interests.&nbsp; Of course, in terms of user friendliness, it is HELPFUL for a product to work in intutive ways across multiple types of platforms.&nbsp; But when a software vendor or service begins to alter a product that WORKS and has an existing constituency to satisfy some NEW constituency on an alternative platform, what mostly results in destruction of the existing franchise.&nbsp; If MS wants to experiment with features that it thinks will appeal to hand held or tablet users, that is just fine as long as MS doesn't mess with the features that WORK on a desktop.&nbsp;Most appalling is the FATWARE that has resulted from the desire to roll out new Skype features.&nbsp;I do NOT WANT OR NEED a 100Mb application choking off resources.&nbsp; I want a lean, efficeint application that consumes no more than 10 Mbs or so of system memory, even if this means shedding 50% of the functionality that I NEVER NEEDED OR USED.&nbsp;MS programmers seem to have FORGOTTEN how to write efficient code (though there is little evidence that&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;has remembered how for more than a decade).&nbsp; In seeking to marry Live Messenger and Skype, giving some legacy functionality, MS has destroyed the core functionality most useful to both constituencies.&nbsp; Performance had gotten worse and worse.&nbsp;This problem is NOT unique ot me.&nbsp; When I communicated with my Skype contacts that the REASON I had signed off of Skype was due to performance problems, they related that they had experienced performance problems, too.&nbsp; When I suggested that they experiment with QUITTING Skype to see if that resolved their performance issues, there was a 100% correlation between those reporting problems and those who reported that these problems DISAPPEARED when they also SHUT DOWN the application.&nbsp;For those of you managers who don't remember, this is called ""Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs!""&nbsp; As you have continued to heap new functionality and features that NO ONE USES OR WANTS and merged two very different software products, you simply DESTROYED the&nbsp;core functionality of your flagship product.&nbsp; Oh, well!&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply cannot afford the productivity liability of having Skype run in the background on my computer any more.&nbsp; The degradation to system performance is now FAR TOO GREAT.&nbsp; I cannot afford to have my computer become UNRESPONSIVE.&nbsp; I cannot afford to continuously REBOOT because Skype is causing problems with other applications.&nbsp;Neither can I afford to spend hours monitoring Forums such as this one searching for solutions to problems that ought NEVER TO HAVE ARISEN because new features have been rolled out which DEGRADE performance and create stability and usability issues.&nbsp; I want an application that I dont have to spend even fifteen minutes a month to relearn or understand.Bye, now!"

SkypeCommunityHistory,24410,"Primary e-mail is wrong, can't change profile, can...","I signed up for Skype yesterday using my Microsoft account. The primary e-mail Skype has on file for me is not correct, it is an old e-mail. I have double-checked my Microsoft account and sure enough my current e-mail is the correct and primary e-mail on the MS account.In addition to this, I cannot change my Skype profile to update the primary e-mail (my current e-mail is there it's just not listed as primary) because every time I do it Skype asks me for a password. I enter my Microsoft password but it keeps telling me it's not correct. I am absolutely 100% sure I am entering the correct password. I can login to Skype successfully with this password but I cannot edit my profile. The password does not have special characters.Earlier today I contacted a Skype representative via live chat, but it was just horrendous. I was on the chat for almost an hour and during this time the chat window made that pencil movement repeatedly as if the rep were typing and about to say something but nothing was said. I think this was done purposely to game the system. Every 5 or 10 minutes I got an answer but it was as if they had no idea what was going on, even though I explained it clearly.And in addition to all this your Skype will not let me fill out an e-mail ticket. First of all it requires the name of 5 Skype contacts to open an e-mail ticket. Why it does that I have no idea but it's ABSURD. I put none, none, none, none, none since I just created my account yesterday and don't have any Skype contacts. Second when I actually submitted the form (I tried multiple times) it says this:Sorry, we’re having some problems at the moment. Please try again later. In the meantime, you can post to the Skype Community or read our FAQs.What a pain in the ass this is, I tell you. Does anyone that works at Skype actually read this board, can you file 4 bugs based on above:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skype retrieved outdated information from my Microsoft account. It did not retrieve the correct primary e-mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skype will not let me change my profile to correct an incorrect primary e-mail without a password, and when I try my Microsoft password which I use to login to Skype it keeps telling me it's incorrect for the profile change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your live chat needs improvement it's like the rep was powerless and didn't understand what I was talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't file an e-mail ticket, either because I don't have 5 Skype contacts (ridiculous rule) or maybe for some other reason it says ""we’re having some problems at the moment""Thanks"

SkypeCommunityHistory,24765,"Support Emoji, and use it as standard smilies on a...","Emoji are standard subset och characters in the Unicode char set. Those can be used as any regular characters. With Windows 8, Android, iOS, Windows Phone? already supporting it system wide. So there's not much work to do for supporting it.ProblemAn emoji is a 4-byte character (codepoint: 1000 – 1FFFF), and Skype can't handle 4-byte characters. Inserting these characters in Skype for Windows 8 will strip these characters, and Skype for Android will make everything like ASCII.SmiliesAs Unicode has a huge set of smilies (emoji), those could be used instead of the limited number of smilies that Skype currently offers.ShortcutsSkype can still offer the shortcuts like : ) which will point to the emoji codepoints - and should replace the text into emoji, and each users chooses if their message should contain emoji. As each system already offers it's own smilies-button on on-screen keyboards - Skype should preferable only show it's smilies-button when a hardware keyboard is present (often PCs).ConsistencyBy letting the system handle the images, all smilies will look the same in all apps, and users knows what to expect of every expression. Also, due to the huge amount of emoji, and if new are introduced - that's nothing Skype has to worry about as each system will take care of that.IssuesAs Skype uses shortcuts for it's smilies, it's sometimes shows them when it ""shouldn't"". Entering aspect ratios like ""4:3"" or math like ""3×( x+8 )"" - the text might look strange. A shortcut should be converted only if it's preceded by a whitespace character. Making the above expressions fine. And by having smilies as Unicode characters makes it easier to know if it should be a smilie or not for the sender, receiver, when viewing past messages, and when editing texts. And system notifications can't handle Skype's custom smilies, but do support the system wide emojiSummary• Support 4-byte characters, to support additional languages• Update Skype's smilies to emoji, for better support• Using emoji will display these in system notifications• Keep shortcuts, but point to emoji - if users wants to• Only use shortcuts when preceded by space, to not mess up texts                                                                                                                                              Status:    Under consideration                We are looking to add Emoji support on Skype for Windows desktop besides the popular&nbsp;Skype emoticons.

How can that be possible when a new version has to be downloaded every time one needs to connect and take the time to install it while on bad connections, in airports etc. and a need for urgency is required?!!! All versions of skype used to connect without hindrances! Now I can not connect simply because I moved the folder of my skype portable to another file folder! Has it occurred to you that Skype used to be used as a cross cultural, cross continental platform for reaching out to people from all over the world?! People would use it while traveling, studying abroad, working abroad or simply from hotels and airports when they needed a ride! Stop tracking our IPs and requiring a consistent IP to sign in! People would also use skype to MEET people cross internationally. That was the most exciting thing about the internet when it came about: Contacting people in other countries and far far away and making friends online! I was absolutely amazed when I once could practice my language skills with someone in a country thousands of miles away! How can that be possible when the default settings are to restrict settings to people on your contact list already?! Yet paradoxically ""ANYONE"" can riskily connect to your computer with a voice call! What kind of tyranny of the default is that?! Has it occurred to you that the first level of security online is ANONYMITY online?! That's why since the advent of the internet people have used ""Handles"", ""Screen names"" and ""nicks""! Stop asking for people's personal information! Has it occurred to you that with touch screens these days and the accidentally hit caps locks keys that someone might accidentally enter their passwords incorrectly more than three times! This is especially the case for the elderly. Stop locking people out of their accounts if they incorrectly enter their passwords more than three times. Security is using ANONYMITY and strong passwords! Make it 10 times at the least! So knock it off! There was a time when software makers strove to make software EASIER to use, more user-friendly (remember that term?!!!) and more accessible, Get back to it! Make Skype more universally accessible. Remove all the restrictions to the connections except of course TSL and SSL. Allow people to connect to each other safely, and anonymously and securely without being SNOOPED upon like the sick creepy stalkers that you are. Allow people to connect using ALL VERSIONS or at least since version 3 to connect to one another."

PURE MICROSOFT ACCOUNT NO OTHER ACCOUNT LINKING.I had to change the primary mail of that account.I was told ""no can do"" by skype support.I found that if I went to account settings and clicked on the link on the line below the one that said ""MICROSOFT etc"" (labeled something along the lines of ""TV or Device"") I got the opportunity to set the password of the ""live:username"" account (WHICH YOU COINCIDENTALLY HAVE TO DO IF YOU WANT TO USE SMART TVs ETC).Once that was done, I COULD SUCCESSFULLY DO WHAT SKYPE SUPPORT SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE- I could change the primary mail address.&nbsp;once that was done, and NOT BEFORE, I linked the account to a facebook account as well, just to be sure I have more than one way to access the skype account.&nbsp;What caused you to get the impression that I was writing something else?&nbsp;furthermore this sentence - ""The solution you described in your initial message isn't actually once since all the time you were operating on different account that weren't actually linked"" does not make sense, I think you mis-edited it.and I need to point out that you are incorrect. I WAS NOT OPERATING ON DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS I WAS OPERATING ON ONE SKYPE ACCOUNT, THAT WAS CREATED USING A MICROSOFT ACCOUNT just like you say you recommend. I still don't know how you can misread my initial entry like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a better solution to my initial problem - changing the primary mail of a skype account created throuth either a microsoft account or a facebook account, Please write a sticky to explain how to do it, and please inform skype support that Yes it can be done, and this is the way it is done.

One of my contact's appeared with the grey question mark. I ended up uninstalling the latest version and going back to the previous version. My contact still has the greyed out question mark but they are still in my contacts. When I change the contact list to show skype contacts only and then select 'Remove contacts who have not shared contact details', they still stay in my contact list. I have also tried the 'show all contacts' and their messenger name then appears too. I tried the 'Remove contacts who haven't shared contact details' again but both their names stay in my contact list.&nbsp; Plus when I check my Outlook contacts list, I can still see the call and video buttons, which only show if a contact is signed in and online, whether invisible or not.&nbsp; If someone had removed you from their contact list then you wouldn't see these call buttons because they only appear to a contact if a person is signed in and showing as 'online' or who are still actually online but in 'invisible' mode'.&nbsp;I could be wrong about this but I think it's possibly a syncing problem.&nbsp; I have now chosen to turn off the automatic updates because I don't want this problem every time Skype updates to a newer version.&nbsp; From reading previous posts, I think there are a few people who have had this issue with contacts suddenly appearing with the grey question mark but who are still in actual fact, contacts of each other and haven't been removed by either party."

I was his account officer before I rose to the position of Managing Director. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 25th of September 2010.Sadly Mr. Weimin was among the death victims in the September 2009 earthquake in Indonesia that left over 1,200 people dead while he was there on a business trip.Since the last quarter of 2010 till date, the management of my bank has been finding means to reach him so as to ascertain if he will roll over the Deposit or have the contract sum withdrawn. When I discovered that this will happen, I have tried to think of a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceeds for business.Some directors here have been trying to find out from me the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed because, I know that if they become aware that Mr. Weimin is late, they will corner the funds for themselves. Therefore, am seeking your co-operation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death since you have the same name, so that my bank headquarters will pay the funds to you. I have done enough inside bank arrangement and I only have to put in your details into the information network in the bank computer system to reflect you as his next of kin.If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 50% of the funds while 50% shall be for me.

I need Skrill credit badly to cover a basic necessity. I'd be more than happy to give my skype useless credit to someone in need, someone who maybe needs to get in touch with a family member, a loved one, or whoever as soon as possible. All I ask in return is that this person has a Skrill count with mentioned balanced available to switch over balances. Is this possible?&nbsp;I hope to find someone of interest, it's very hard to get to someone who has a need like this but after Skrill support re-directed me to Skype support and Skype support told me to post away on the boards, this could very well be my last shot at getting this done. I don't want the Skype credit to be stalled and I think Skype wouldn't like this either. I want to give it to someone in useful need. Like I said, all I need in return is 6,25€ in my skrill account and as easily as that both I and the interested person will benefit from the transaction in a matter of minutes!&nbsp;I do aknowledge that this trade is not the most common, so I appeal to anyone on the Skype community that has a Skrill account, Even if you don't have any (present) use for further Skype credit (but might need it in the future?) I am the person you should be doing this trade with.&nbsp;Please, moderators, anyone. Could someone fix this trade for me as soon as possible. Probably this would mean nothing to you as of right now but I must make reference, unfortunetly, to a not so good family situation I'm going through right now and I need this e-currency credit exchange. So I can at least guarantee a basic meal for over the weekend for my family, that's my urgency. I hope at least one of you can help me out given the emergency of the situation.&nbsp;I re-enforce, it's an e-currency trade and not some attempt at charity. I just need this skype credit converted into skrill credit badly until friday. It would help a family a lot in here. Thank you skype community.

Many people including myself&nbsp;would like to see this feature implemented in the Linux client.&nbsp;There are solutions to protect the IP from resolvers like&nbsp;setting up proxies. However, the performance of free SOCKS-proxies is mostly very bad. VPNs with an appropriate bandwidth also cost an amount of money and additionally, it is difficult to&nbsp;only route Skype traffic through a VPN. Setting up a VM with Windows or WINE just to run Skype is an overkill as well.&nbsp;I consider it inconvenient that this feature is implemented on Windows while - in my opinion - mainly Linux users being aware of security might be in need for this feature. Therefore, I request to implement such a functionality into the Linux client.&nbsp;Kind regards from Germany                                                                                                                  Solved!

Meanwhile, I escalated my issue with Samsung Management for misleading info and reviews and the amount of time I spent speaking with (6) agents that asked me the same info and gave me nothing but disappointment.&nbsp;If you are not sure that it is 100% compatible with your TV, I suggest you don't buy it. I based my decision from the reviews and Samsung's response and it still did not work. Also if your TV is Canadian, buy the webcam from Canada. If you buy from the U.S., you will have firmware issues and definitely will not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;End result - my kind of TV Samsung 5300 will not work with any Samsung webcam regardless what Skype tells you when you log on."

Can I select which ""account"" to use when making the original call?  3. Is Skype working on either of those solutions, or anything similar?    &nbsp;Hello and welcome to the Skype Community.  1. Unfortunately not. Calls can't be switched seamlessly when there's a change in the call charging protocol. Calls are charged at different rates between Subscriptions and Credit.  2. Again this isn't possible. The system will automatically choose the cheaper option and can't be manually overridden.  3. No. As a workaround you could establish a second account and use it for selected calls funded solely by Credit.                              TIME ZONE - US EASTERN.  LOCATION - PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA.I recommend that you always run the latest Skype version: Windows &amp; MacIf my advice helped to fix your issue please mark it as a solution to help others.Please note that I generally don't respond to unsolicited Private Messages.

SkypeCommunityHistory,27190,"Be abke to add own custom emoticons to Skype, like...","Hi!I think a vital point to all messenger interfaces is the ability to use good emoticons/smilies/emoji for people to express themselves in more fun ways. Before there was skype, there was MSN messenger and it can't be denied that the biggest misery in the loss of MSN was the fact that there would no longer be a good messenger interface that provided the same function to add your own custom emoticons. And after having no choice but to move onto Skype, I was greatly disappointed by the poor and limited emoticons available. To be quite honest, they suck so much that neither I or any of my friends even use them. It used to be really different and fun to be able to use your own custom emoticons, because you'd have your own person collection of them that you could send to anyone, anywhere. It never ever got boring and I feel this is something that Skype GREATLY lacks.&nbsp;Perhaps this is something that is difficult to accomplish in skype and perhaps requires a lot of software work, however i feel it would really be worth all the effort to add this feature and surely will benefit you and all skype users happier with their skype experiences.I would not believe that this is something that can't be done, because MSN messenger was capable of having it and i believe Skype is ought to be far more advanced, however as of yet &nbsp;I still think skype is inferior to MSN mainly due to this reason.At least please add this function for PC/laptop if it is too hard for mobile. (although if facebook is able to display advanced smileys in its messenger, then again im not sure why skype couldn't)Thank you for reading and I sincerely hope this suggestion will be considered and that you'll add this function! &nbsp;                                                                                                                                              Status:    Duplicate                Thank you for the feedback. Custom emoticons are being considered. There are other custom emoticon requests such as http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client-Ideas/Custom-Emotes/idi-p/2890639 If other users would like this added, please add your kudos there."
SkypeCommunityHistory,27293,Bring back the Live Messenger Feature for emoticon...,"Hello Skype Community!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the feature we had nack in the Old Days in Live Messenger? To be able to add our own emoticons ..? Well to be honest i really miss that, and since Live Messenger isnt available anymore because we now use Skype for that, it'll AWSOME if you guys could readd this feature to Skype.&nbsp;I mean, if you think about it, there are millions of people using Skype nowadays. Imagine how this feature will change the way people chat from Skype. Being able to add and use unique emoticons to express feelings with funny or sad unique emoticons. I still remember how it was when i was chatting with friends and poof! ""Oh! there's an emoticon i never seen. Wow it looks cool, i think ill add it too"" or "" that one doesnt look that good i dont want it"" &nbsp;Back then we were able to decide which emoticons we &nbsp;like and wanted to use and which not. But now , we can only use the standart ones. They're pretty cool and stuff but its the same every single time and at some point it get kinda boring..&nbsp;I really wish this goes under Consideration and hopefully be there to use in the next updates &nbsp;Thanks a lot for reading this! ^^"

SkypeCommunityHistory,27408,"Skype won't let me call, message, or let me change...","Hello everyone, I have serveral problems on my Skype. I use Skype on Windows 8. I have had these problems once or twice and I usually fixed it by simply deleting the program and redownloading it. I got the issue again and I don't mostly everything to fix it but nothing works. The issue or problem im having is pretty simple I can't CALL, MESSAGE, or CHANGE MY STATUS. Everytime I message someone something it just never sends and the loading thing just keeps circuling around and around and never sends. When i send a picture all it say is ""Failed To Upload/Send."" When I try calling the call never rings and just stays there forever and i can't end it. I usually have to restart my Skype to get out of it. The last issue is changing my status. Usually, when i change my status the program doesnt do anything. Basically those are my issues for my Skype. I saw some other people having the similar issue. Some helping people gave them some advice. I followed the steps to fix the problem. I tried first by doing the- Press the Windows Key and R and type in %appdata%. Then it said to rename the skype folder ""Old_Skype"". I did that but sadly another problem occured. IT said you cannot rename because this file is open in another program/place I don't know where because i already closed my skype and quit out of it. The second thing i did was to- Press the Windows Key again and to click R and to type in %temp%/skype. Next I had to delete a folder called ""DbTemp"". The same problem again occurred - You cannot delete this folder because the file is open in another program/place. I decided to rethink and get the Modern Skype for windows. The original problem was still there. I cant call or message or change my status on either of my Skypes (Skype Desktop and Modern Windows Skype). I gave a thought and said what if it was my computer. I denied that thought because my internet browser and regular PC games still worked and operated just fine. Then i said what if its just my skype profile itself ? I also countered that thought by the fact I was still able to use skype on my mobile phone. THIS ISSSUE IS REALLY A PAIN KILLER. I USE SKYPE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH FRIENDS AND I CANNOT CONVINCE THEM TO USE ANOTHER PROGRAM INSTEAD OF SKYPE. AND USING MY MOBILE DEVICE WHILE PLAYING PC GAMES ON MY COMPUTER MAKES MY GAMES LAG AND CRASH.

I was one of the first people globally to use Skype and what you have been doing recently&nbsp;is ruining it. Each new version seems to get slower and more problematic....&nbsp;&nbsp;The newest interface you have created is obviously heavy &amp; demanding. Doing even the essentials takes too much time: EVERYTHING now is slow: loading up, changing from contacts to recent, starting a call, accepting a call..... Slow and cumbersome &amp; frequently buggy too! Just because average device processing power, RAM capacity &amp; connection speeds have increased does not mean you should throw an unnecessarily 'heavy' app together.&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;used to be almost instantaneous. I think you are trying to make it too clever &amp; too graphical - and as a result you have lost the essence of what made Skype Skype= Quick, easy, problem-free point &amp; shoot comms.&nbsp;Now I almost hate having to use it as I can almost always be assured that a wait and new bugs will appear.Please simplify. Simplify. Simpify. Back to basics. Lighter. Back to the essentials of what it is for. Thanks"
