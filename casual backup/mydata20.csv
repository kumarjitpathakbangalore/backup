                I have once visited Korea and used my usual Skype account from there. Interestingly, according to Skype, I'm now forever based in Korea and my account is linked to some weird Korean provider making it difficult to perform the simplest transaction. Skype's customer service, unhelpful and arrogant to say the least, was trying to convince me that I set up my account with their Korean partner. It didn't matter that my account was set up years ago before they even entered into the partnership. The individual I was speaking with, didn't even bother to check these details, instead I was requested to verify my address by sending them a bank statement/ bill (?!?!) Once document received, the process on their end would take min 24-48 hours. Of course, she was deaf to me saying that I urgently need to purchase the service, I'm not based in Korea, I don't even speak Korean and I only holidayed there for 4 days! She also did not care explaining why Skype members are not being warned that using Skype from selected countries can link their accounts to some dodgy Skype substitutes. This is my 2nd run in with Skype's shocking customer service in 4 weeks, both were equally ridiculous and frustrating. Skype used to be my favourite service, but it has hit rock bottom, time for a replacement.

                If you need Skype for any sort of chat/voice/video that deos NOT imclude using a regular mobile or landline telephone connection Skype is competative - However if you need to use it in order to purchase a telephone number is any of a wide variety of coutries - avoid it like a plague because the prices are truly outrageous ($6 a month compared to $0-$1 a month by average of the sites that I examined - and if you want a refund  - keep on dreaming!

                DO NOT TOP UP YOUR SKYPE ACCOUNT!!!It is probably rated TOP SECRET and above by Microsoft... how many accounts have been locked due to their software failure and later the inability to say the simple word \"Sorry\"... what is even worse is that third party attempting to infiltrate your account to prevent sending your messages as in cases with human rights violation... leads automatically to lock down of the account. In a way that means that the government can shut down now practically all your accounts GMAIL, SKYPE, YAHOO, FACEBOOK by just attempting to sign in... to recover your account is unfortunately not that simple. Basically if you give SKYPE all the information it ask from you, you shouldn't wonder if your bank account is infiltrated thereafter:SKYPE and Microsoft are aware of it and yet willingly or unwillingly they are supporting criminals and militant regimes with their inability to see pass their rules of secrecy...Considering the absolute disinterest from Microsoft to provide adequate service and take customer seriously... there is only one conclusion possible. The independent SKYPE was too much of annoyance for corporate America... as long SKYPE existed no one would have made money. Considering the amount Microsoft paid for SKYPE and the disinterest now it is more than a conspiracy theory. The new way of doing business... buy it, run it down and dispose of it. If Microsoft was the alone buyer or it was a joint venture we will of course never know. What we have here is a war between corporate America and the independent world of the free users. Most of us are using Facebook and despite the poor quality still hanging to the ruins of SKYPE without giving it a thought... no wonder with generation of papa Simpson coming into being we have never been in graver danger to go under the wheels of the corporate and government whimsicalities.Stop using SKYPE or you are putting your life and the life of other people in danger.Jani Jakimov

                I have been using skype for several years in work capacity. It was a fabulous product until MS took over. Since then it has been on a downhill due to Microsoft trying to monopolise it and add unnecessary features to it to make profits out of the software.Very poor stability, awful user experience, application unstable most of the time, Inability to answer calls, multiple interfaces kicking up on incoming calls, issues when multiple sound devices connected and the list goes on. Shameful for a company like MS who has huge brain, technology and financial resources.

                JA JA SKYPE FUNGERER DA GODT.... MEN i skyggen af alle de gode funktioner Skype ligger frem til os forburgere, bliver de knapt så stuerene metoder fejet ind under tæppet. Her taler jeg om Skype-kredit, som man sætter ind på sin konto for derefter at kunne skrive og ringe til andet end computere. Det er en god mulighed at have, hvis det så bare ikke var fordi de kører det som en gangstar forretning! Hvis ikke man benytter pengene inden for et givent tidspunkt, tager Skype dem bare udenvidere, eller som de selv siger fjerner de inaktive midler og gør plads til aktive! Direkte ulovligt efter min mening, når man betaler for en service hvor idéen er hele tiden at have en kredit. Jeg nævnte det for en medarbejder, da de havde snuppet 80 dkk af mine penge, hvorefter hun sagde at de da havde advaret mig pr mail.. Direkte tyverie er åbenbart ok hvis man bare lige advarer først..

                I sent a number of Skype sms text to my girlfriend's mobile and she received none of the messages, although I have £10 of credit.  After making the messages I was charged for them (the Skype credit has deductions made for the messages) and it says that they were delivered but she did not receive them.  When I use my regular Tesco mobile to contact her she receives the message.  I think Skype free services are excellent but their sms to a foreign mobile (UK to Austria) are a waste of money.  I only lost £10.  I suppose they collect revenue for their free services this way :-)  Last £10 you'll get from me.

                Det er dejligt med Skype, når der skal snakkes med udlandet, men kvaliteten kunne godt være lidt bedre sommetider

                I have had been using Skype for a few years as a free user, I starting working away from home so I subscribed to a Skype service with a recurring payment. Everything seemed great, then one day I received an email stated my email address had changed, then shortly after I received two emails from PayPal referring to two successful payments to Skype (this was all at the beginning of Oct 2013). I had not changed my email or made the payment so I tried to contact Skype, unfortunately Skype don't have a helpline number, they do have web chat but you need to log in, and at this time my password had also been changed by the person that had taken over my account. So I had to complete an online form, I received a reference and a note stating someone would contact me within 24hours. At this point someone was taking money from my account and Skype wanted me to wait, I contacted PayPal who stated that the payment was automatic so couldn't be stopped, so I phoned my bank, they stopped all payment to PayPal and the payment in process. So the next day I received an email from Skype stating that something with my request was incorrect and I was to follow a link to complete an online form, I selected the link which took me to the same page as I completed the day before, so I completed the form and also emailed Skype contactus address, again the message stated I would receive and email within 24 hours and again the same email back, to complete the online form. I replied to the emails but with no response, this went on until later November. So as I was getting nowhere I started to get fed up, so I tried the forgot password link after a few weeks of trying to change my password, I received a new one. So I could now access my account, when I logged into the account I noticed I was in credit for the two payment, so I tried the web chat to solve the problem but the guy told me to follow a link or try the contactus email, the link was for the online that I completed at the start, but I tried the form again but was still doing something wrong so nobody would help me, so I asked the online chat to help but again the same link. This went on for a bit, then in about March 2014 I received an email stating my account had been taken over so was block to protect me (5 months after I reported it), I tried to resolve the issue but got fed up, so stopped using Skype. It is now January 2015 and received an email stating my balance is due to expiry, this is to an account that is blocked.I am not saying don't use Skype because the free service is good but what ever you do don't use any paid service because your money isn't safe. When I had my problems I also posted it on the Skype online community, to my surprise I found that I wasn't alone and many people had lost money, some in the hundreds but Skype aren't interested.

                Har forsøgt at sende mere end 3 mails til deres email for hjælp omkring falsk aktivitet af en konti. Desuden har jeg skrevet til dem på Facebook. De ignorere mig fuldstændigt.

                Skype peut et doit encore progresser, mais quoiqu'en disent certains, la qualité vidéo, la qualité générale des connexions quand on prend des abonnements en VoIP est très bonne, bien meilleure que d'autres applications PC et téléphone mobile. La qualité d'appel est bien meilleure d'ailleurs avec un PC qu'avec un téléphone portable, mais là encore, rien de surprenant. Privilégiez la connexion ethernet quand c'est possible, c'est meilleur.

                jeg kan ikke få deres program til at virke. Det eneste som virker rigig godt er deres betalings-del. hvad gør man hvis man gerne vil slette det og dermed ikke betale til dem. herunder deres autobetaling.

                Update d. 14. jan. 2015:Skype hæver 120 kr. fra min PayPal.Jeg har aldrig sagt ja til noget autobetaling, og derfor trækker PayPal da også pengene hjem igen.Skype gør nu det, at de blokere mine 45 kroner som jeg havde på min Skype konto. Altså tyveri.Jeg kontakter nu Skype og spørger hvorfor?Fordi siger de ... at de ikke er sikker på, at jeg er ejeren af kontoen ???Jeg fortæller dem nu (i deres chat-support), at jeg allerede er logget ind på Skype-delen af kontoen, da jeg som den eneste af 7 milliarder mennesker kender koden. Men nej, dette var ikke nok ???Hun giver mig nu et link, til en formular jeg skal udfylde for 4. gang, som jeg også fortæller hende. Men nej igen. Hvis ikke jeg udfyldte formularen igen kunne de ikke hjælpe mig.Jeg åbner nu linket til formularen, men denne er nu også blokeret for kontoen som problemet vedrører.Det lykkedes nu at udfylde formularen vha. en anden konto-navn, og jeg slutter med at fortælle i kommentarfeltet, hvordan alting hænger sammen.Jeg klikker på send, og får beskeden, at jeg vil høre fra dem indenfor 24 timer. Og det er så 10 dage siden nu. Og ja, du har gættet det; \"ingen svar\".Jo, Skype er bare endnu et svindlerfirma, som gør alting forkert, når det kommer til kundesupport.Og hvor er det bare trist, at Microsoft nu har indgået et partnerskab med disse tyveknægte.

                Update: After much time, many emails with requests and very bad reviews online, I finally managed to get my discount, so I change this review from 1 to 3 stars.Background: I was purchasing an item online, and it had a 20% discount on it. First of all, it took very long for Skype online shop to process my order. Second, they \"forgot\" about the discount. Then, when I contacted customer support, they assured me they would take care of it. Nothing happened. I asked and asked, they said they would deal with it. Month and a half - and nothing has happened!Furthermore, as I live in Denmark with very high customs fees, I only wanted to buy something shipped out of Europe to avoid customs fees. This product was shipped out of Hong Kong, which they mentioned nothing about online. I contacted customer support also about this, and the same thing happened: They said they would deal with it, \"rest assured\" and other meaningless words, and nothing has ever happened. Finally, the product is not the quality that was described online at all! The price for that product was way too high for its value. Be careful.
